THE STORY OF THE
PULLMAN CAR</p>




<h2 class="nopagebreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subheader">THE BIRTH OF RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION</span></h2>


<p>Since those distant days when man's migratory
instinct first prompted him to find fresh hunting
fields and seek new caves in other lands,
human energy has been constantly employed in
moving from place to place. The fear of starvation
and other elementary causes prompted the earliest
migrations. Conquest followed, and with increasing
civilization came the establishment of constant
intercourse between distant places for reasons that
found existence in military necessity and commercial
activity.</p>

<p>For centuries the sea offered the easiest highway,
and the fleets of Greece and Rome carried the culture
and commerce of the day to relatively great
distances. Then followed the natural development
of land communication, and at once arose the necessity
<a class="pagenum" id="page_002" title="2"> </a>
not only for vehicles of transportation but for
suitable roads over which they might pass with comfort,
speed, and safety. Over the Roman roads the
commerce of a great empire flowed in a tumultuous
stream. Wheeled vehicles rumbled along the
highways&mdash;heavy springless carts to carry the merchandise,
lightly rolling carriages for the comfort of
wealthy travelers.</p>

<p>The elementary principle still remains. The
wheel and the paved way of Roman days correspond
to the four-tracked route of level rails and the ponderous
steel wheels of the mighty Mogul of today.
In speed, scope, capacity, and comfort has the
change been wrought.</p>

<p>The English stagecoach marked a sharp advance
in the progress of passenger transportation. With
frequent relays of fast horses a fair rate of speed
was maintained, and comfort was to a degree effected
by suspension springs of leather and by interior
upholstery.</p>

<p>An interesting example of the height of luxury
achieved by coach builders was the field carriage of
the great Napoleon, which he used in the campaign
of 1815. This carriage was captured by the English
<a class="pagenum" id="page_003" title="3"> </a>
at Waterloo, and suffered the ignominious fate of
being later exhibited in Madame Tussaud's wax-work
show in London. The coach was a model of
compactness, and contained a bedstead of solid steel
so arranged that the occupant's feet rested in a box
projecting beyond the front of the vehicle. Over the
front windows was a roller blind, which, when
pulled down admitted the air but excluded rain.
The <i>secrétaire</i> was fitted up for Napoleon by Marie
Louise, with nearly a hundred articles, including a
magnificent breakfast service of gold, a writing desk,
perfumes, and spirit lamp. In a recess at the bottom
of the toilet box were two thousand gold napoleons,
and on the top of the box were places for the
imperial wardrobe, maps, telescopes, arms, liquor
case, and a large silver chronometer by which the
watches of the army were regulated. In such
quarters did the great emperor jolt along over the
execrable roads of Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>The stagecoach was established in England as a
public conveyance early in the sixteenth century,
and soon regular routes were developed throughout
the country. Now for the first time a closed vehicle
afforded travelers comparative comfort during their
<a class="pagenum" id="page_004" title="4"> </a>
journey, and in the stagecoach with its definite
schedule may be seen the early prototype of the modern
passenger railroad. For three centuries the
stagecoach slowly developed, and its popularity carried
it to the continent and later to America. But
by a radical invention transportation was suddenly
transformed.</p>

<p>As early as the middle of the sixteenth century,
and actually contemporaneous with the inception of
the stagecoach, railways, or wagon-ways, had their
origin. At first these primitive railways were built
exclusively to serve the mining districts of England
and consisted of wooden rails over which horse-drawn
wagons might be moved with greater ease
than over the rough and rutted roads.</p>

<p>The next step forward was brought about by the
natural wear of the wheels on the wooden tracks,
and consisted of a method of sheathing the rails with
thin strips of iron. To avoid the buckling which
soon proved a fault of this innovation, the first actual
iron rails were cast in 1767 by the Colebrookdale
Iron Works. These rails were about three feet in
length and were flanged to keep the wagon wheels
on the track.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_005" title="5"> </a>
For a number of years this simple type of railroad
existed with little change. Over it freight alone
was carried, and its natural limitations and high
cost, compared with the transportation afforded by
canals, seemed to hold but little promise for future
expansion.</p>

<p>As early as 1804 Richard Trevithick had experimented
with a steam locomotive, and in the ten
years following other daring spirits endeavored to
devise a practical application of the steam engine to
the railway problem. But in 1814 George Stephenson's
engine, the "Blucher," actually drew a train of
eight loaded wagons, a total weight of thirty tons,
at a speed of four miles an hour, and the age of the
steam railroad had begun.</p>

<p>The first railroad to adopt steam as its motive
power was the Stockton &amp; Darlington, a "system"
comprising three branches and a total of thirty-eight
miles of track. On the advice of Stephenson, horse
power was not adopted and several steam engines
were built to afford the motive power. This road
was opened on September 27, 1825, and preceded
by a signalman on horseback a train of thirty-four
vehicles weighing about ninety tons departed from
<a class="pagenum" id="page_006" title="6"> </a>
the terminus with the applause of the amazed spectators.</p>

<p>The novelty of this new venture soon appealed
so strongly to popular fancy that a month later a
passenger coach was added, and a daily schedule
between Stockton &amp; Darlington was inaugurated.</p>

<p>This first railway carriage for the transportation
of passengers was aptly named the "Experiment."
Consisting of the body of a stagecoach it accommodated
approximately twenty-five passengers, of
which number six found accommodations within,
while the others perched on the exterior and the
roof of the vehicle. The fare for the trip was one
shilling, and each passenger was permitted to carry
fourteen pounds of baggage.</p>

<p>This early adaption of the stagecoach to the
rapidly developed demand for passenger service
necessitated the coinage of a new terminology, and
it is not surprising that many words of stagecoach
days remained. Among these "coach" is still preserved,
and in England the engineer is still called
the "driver"; the conductor, "guard"; locomotive
attendants in the roundhouse, "hostlers," and the
roundhouse tracks the "stalls."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_007" title="7"> </a>
In 1829 a prize of five hundred pounds ($2,500)
for the best engine was offered by the directors of
the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway which was
to be opened in the following year, and at the trial
which was held in October three locomotives constructed
on new and high-speed principles were
entered. These were the "Rocket" by George and
Robert Stephenson, the "Novelty" by John Braithwaite
and John Erickson, and the "Sanspareil"
by Timothy Hackworth. Due to the failure of
the "Novelty" and the "Sanspareil" to complete
the trial run and the successful performance of the
"Rocket" in meeting the terms of the competition,
the Stephensons were awarded the prize and received
an order for seven additional locomotives. It is
interesting to learn that on its initial trip the
"Rocket" attained the unprecedented speed of
twenty-five miles an hour.</p>

<p>In 1819 Benjamin Dearborn, of Boston, memorialized
Congress in regard to "a mode of propelling
wheel-carriages" for "conveying mail and passengers
with such celerity as has never before been

memorial from the committee to which it was
referred.</p>

</div>

<p>The development of the locomotive in America
approximates its development in England. As early
as 1827 four miles of track were laid between
Quincy and Boston for the transportation of granite
for the Bunker Hill Monument. Horses furnished
<a class="pagenum" id="page_009" title="9"> </a>
the power, and the cars were drawn over wooden
rails fastened to stone sleepers.</p>

  <p class="caption1"><i>"The Best Friend," the first locomotive built for actual service

Railroad, January 15, 1831.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But reports of the wonders of the new English
railways soon crossed the water, and in 1828 Horatio
Allen was commissioned by the Delaware &amp; Hudson
Canal Company to purchase four locomotives in
England for use on its new line from Carbondale to
Honesdale, Pennsylvania. Of these locomotives
three were constructed by Foster, Rastrick, and
Company, of Stourbridge, and one by George
Stephenson. The first engine to arrive was the
"Stourbridge Lion" and on the ninth of August,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_010" title="10"> </a>
1829, it was placed on the primitive wooden rails
and, to the amazement of the spectators, Allen
opened the throttle and in a cloud of smoke and
hissing steam moved down the track at the prodigious
speed of ten miles an hour.</p>

<p>One of the first railways in America was the old
Mohawk &amp; Hudson, which was chartered by an act
of the New York legislature on April 17, 1826. The
commissioners who were entrusted with the duty of
organizing the company met for the purpose in the
office of John Jacob Astor, in New York City, on
July 29, 1826. One of their first official acts was to
appoint Peter Heming chief engineer and send him
to England to examine as to the feasibility of building
a railroad. Mr. Heming's salary was fixed at
$1,500 a year. In due course of time he returned
from his European visit of observation and reported
in favor of the project under consideration. Notwithstanding
that he was absent six months, the
expenses of his trip, charged by him to the company,
were only $335.59. The road first used horse power
and later on adopted steam for use in the day time,
retaining horses, however, for night work. It was
not deemed safe to use steam after dark. At first
<a class="pagenum" id="page_011" title="11"> </a>
the trains consisted of one car each, in construction
closely resembling the old-fashioned stagecoach.</p>

<p>The road connected the two towns of Albany and
Schenectady, and was seventeen miles in length,
but the portion operated by steam was only fourteen
miles in length, horses being used on the
inclined plane division from the top of one hill to
the top of another.</p>

</div>

<p>Three years later a prize of $4,000 was offered
by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company for an American
engine, and the following year a locomotive constructed
by Davis and Gastner won the award by
drawing fifteen tons at the rate of fifteen miles an
hour. In 1832, Matthias W. Baldwin, founder of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_012" title="12"> </a>
the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia,
designed his first locomotive, "Old Ironsides," for
the Philadelphia, Germantown &amp; Morristown Railroad;
and soon after his second locomotive, the "E.
L. Miller," was put in service on the South Carolina
Railroad.</p>

<p>The journal of Samuel Breck of Boston, affords
an interesting glimpse of the conditions of contemporary
railroad travel:</p>

<p class="citation"><i>July 22, 1835.</i> This morning at nine o'clock I took
passage on a railroad car (from Boston) for Providence.
Five or six other cars were attached to the locomotive,
and uglier boxes I do not wish to travel in. They were
made to stow away some thirty human beings, who sit
cheek by jowl as best they can. Two poor fellows who
were not much in the habit of making their toilet, squeezed
me into a corner, while the hot sun drew from their garments
a villainous compound of smells made up of salt
fish, tar, and molasses. By and by just twelve&mdash;only
twelve&mdash;bouncing factory girls were introduced, who
were going on a party of pleasure to Newport. "Make
room for the ladies!" bawled out the superintendent.
"Come gentlemen, jump up on top; plenty of room
there!" "I'm afraid of the bridge knocking my brains
out," said a passenger. Some made one excuse, and some
another. For my part, I flatly told him that since I had
belonged to the corps of Silver Grays I had lost my gallantry
and did not intend to move. The whole twelve
were, however, introduced, and soon made themselves at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_014" title="14"> </a>
home, sucking lemons, and eating green apples....
The rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant, the
polite and the vulgar, all herd together in this modern
improvement in traveling ... and all this for the
sake of doing very uncomfortably in two days what
would be done delightfully in eight or ten.</p>

</div>

<p>To follow further the rapid development of the
railroad in America would require many volumes.
As the canal building fever had seized the fancy of
the American public in preceding years, so a similar
enthusiasm was instantly kindled in the new railroad,
and railroad travel became immediately the
most popular diversion. In a relatively few years
a web of track carried the smoking locomotive and
its rumbling train of cars throughout the country.
Crude, and lacking almost every convenience of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_015" title="15"> </a>
passenger coach of the present day, the early railway
carriage served fully its new-born function. To
the latter half of the century was reserved the
development of those refinements which have rendered
travel safe and comfortable, and the perfecting
of those vast organizations that have placed in
American hands the railroad supremacy of the world.</p>

CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subheader">THE EVOLUTION OF THE SLEEPING CAR</span></h2>


<p>The history of improved railway travel may be
said to date from the year 1836, when the
first sleeping car was offered to the traveling public.
In the years which followed the actual inception of
the railroad in the United States, railway travel was
fraught with discomfort and inconvenience beyond
the realization of the present day. Travel by canal
boat had at least offered a relative degree of comfort,
for here comfortable berths in airy cabins were
provided as well as good meals and entertainment,
but the locomotive, by its greatly increased speed
over the plodding train of tow mules, instantly commanded
the situation, and as the mileage of the
pioneer roads increased, travel by boat proportionately
languished.</p>

<p>The first passenger cars were little better than
boxes mounted on wheels. Over the uneven track
the locomotive dragged its string of little coaches,
each smaller than the average street car of today.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_020" title="20"> </a>
From the engine a pall of suffocating smoke and
glowing sparks swept back on the partially protected
passengers. Herded like cattle they settled
themselves as comfortably as possible on the stiff-backed,
narrow benches. The cars were narrow and
scant head clearance was afforded by the low, flat
roof. From the dirt roadbed a cloud of dust blew
in through open windows, in summer mingled with
the wood smoke from the engine. In winter, a wood
stove vitiated the air. Screens there were none.
By night the dim light from flaring candles barely
illuminated the cars.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img class="plain" src="images/p020i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption1"><i>Car in use in 1844 on the Michigan Central Railroad. Interesting

and how soon they approached the modern type of car in general
appearance.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In addition to these physical discomforts were
added the dangers attending the operation of trains
<a class="pagenum" id="page_021" title="21"> </a>
entirely unprotected by any of the safety devices
now so essential to the modern railroad. No road
boasted of a double track; there was no telegraph
by which to operate the trains. The air brake was
unknown until 1869, when George Westinghouse
received his patent. The Hodge hand brake which
was introduced in 1849 was but a poor improvement
on the inefficient hand brake of the earlier days.
The track was usually laid with earth ballast and
the rail joints might be easily counted by the passengers
as the cars pounded over them. Add to these
discomforts the necessity of frequent changes from
<a class="pagenum" id="page_022" title="22"> </a>
one short line to another when it was necessary for
the passengers each time to purchase new tickets and
personally pick out their baggage, due to the absence
of coupon tickets and baggage checks, and the joys
of the tourist may be realized.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img class="plain" src="images/p021i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption1"><i>Car constructed by M. P. and M. E. Green of Hoboken, New
Jersey, in 1831 for the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad.</i></p>
</div>

<p>As early as 1836 the officers of the Cumberland
Valley Railroad of Pennsylvania installed a
sleeping-car service between Harrisburg and Chambersburg.
This first sleeping car was, as was later
the first Pullman car, an adaption of an ordinary
day coach to sleeping requirements. It was divided
into four compartments in each of which three bunks
were built against one side of the car, and in the
rear of the car were provided a towel, basin, and
water. No bed clothes were furnished and the weary
passengers fully dressed reclined on rough mattresses
with their overcoats or shawls drawn over them,
doubtless marveling the while at the fruitfulness of
modern invention. As time went on other similar
cars, with berths arranged in three tiers on one side
of the car, were adopted by various railroads, and
occasional but in no manner fundamental improvements
were made. Candles furnished the light, and
the heat was supplied by box stoves burning wood
<a class="pagenum" id="page_023" title="23"> </a>
or sometimes coal. For a number of years these
makeshift cars found an appreciative patronage, and
temporarily served the patrons of the road.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img class="plain" src="images/p023i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption1"><i>Midnight in the old coaches previous to the introduction of
the Pullman sleeping car. A night journey in those days was something
to be dreaded.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the next ten years similar "bunk" cars were
adopted by other railroads, but improvements were
negligible and their only justification existed in the
ability of the passengers to recline at length during
the long night hours. The innovation of bedding
furnished by the railroad marked a slight progress,
but the rough and none too clean sheets and blankets
which the passengers were permitted to select from
a closet in the end of the car, must have failed even
in that day to give satisfaction to the fastidious.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_024" title="24"> </a>
But in the early fifties these very inconveniences
fired the imagination of a young traveler who had
bought a ticket on a night train between Buffalo
and Westfield, and in his alert mind was inspired,
as he tossed sleepless in his bunk, the first vision of
a car that would revolutionize the railroad travel
of the world and of a system that would present to
the traveling public a mighty organization whose
first purpose would be to contribute safety, convenience,
luxury and a uniform and universal service
from coast to coast.</p>

<p>George Mortimer Pullman was born in Brockton,
Chautauqua County, New York, March 3, 1831.
His early schooling was limited to the country
schoolhouse, and at the age of fourteen his education
was completed and he obtained employment at a
salary of $40 a year in a small store in Westfield,
New York, that supplied the neighboring farmers
with their simple necessities. But the occupation of
a country storekeeper failed to fix the restless mind
of the boy, and three years later he packed his few
possessions and moved to Albion, New York, where
an older brother had developed a cabinet-making
business.</p>

<div class="illustration">

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_025" title="25"> </a>
Here Pullman found a wider field for his natural
abilities, and at the same time acquired a knowledge
of wood working and construction that was soon to
afford the foundation for larger enterprises. During
the ten years that followed there were times when
the demands on the little shop of the Pullman brothers
failed to afford sufficient occupation for the two
young cabinet makers, and the younger brother,
eager to improve his opportunities, began to accept
outside contracts of various sorts. The state of New
York had begun to widen the Erie Canal which
passed through Albion. Clustered on its banks were
numerous warehouses and other buildings, and the
young man soon proved his ability to contract successfully
for the necessary moving of these buildings
back to the new banks of the canal. The venture
was successful. An opportunity fortuitously created
was seized, and not only was an increased livelihood
secured, but the wider scope of this new activity
gave the young man an increased confidence in himself
on which to enlarge his future activities.</p>

<p>It was during these years that George M. Pullman
experienced his first night travel and the hardships
of the sleeping car accommodations. As Fulton and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_026" title="26"> </a>
Watt and Stephenson, in the crude steam engine of
their time, saw the locomotive and marine engine
of today, so in this bungling sleeper George M.
Pullman saw the modern sleeping car and the vast
system he was in time to originate. In his mind a
score of ideas were immediately presented and on his
return to Albion he discussed the possibility of their
amplification with Assemblyman Ben Field, a warm
friend in these early days.</p>

<p>The contracting business had increased Pullman's
field of observation, it had stimulated his invention,
it had accustomed him to the management of men.
When the widening of the Erie Canal had been
accomplished, the field for his new vocation was
practically eliminated; and it was but natural that
the ambition of youth could not be satisfied to return
to the cabinet-making business. Westward lay the
future. In the new town of Chicago, which had in
so few years grown up at the foot of Lake Michigan,
young men were already building world enterprises.
Chicago, named from the wild onion that grew in
the marsh lands about the winding river, offered
promise of greatness. Its romantic growth seized
the imagination of the youthful Albion contractor.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_027" title="27"> </a>
Naturally his first thought was to profit by his
contracting experience, and again a happy chance
favored him. Built on the low land behind the
sand dunes and south of the sluggish river Chicago
suffered from a lack of proper drainage. Mud
choked the streets; cellars were wells of water after
every rain. In 1855, the year of his arrival, Pullman
made a contract to raise the level of certain of
the city streets. It was a bold undertaking, but his
confidence knew no hesitation, and the work was
satisfactorily accomplished. Other contracts followed,
and in a short time Pullman had built himself
a substantial reputation and had raised a number
of blocks of brick and stone buildings, including
the famous Tremont House, to the new level.</p>

<p>Chicago in 1858 was a town of 100,000 population.
Here Cyrus H. McCormick had built his
reaper factory on the banks of the river. Here R.
T. Crane was laying the small foundation for the
mighty industry of future years. Here Marshall
Field and Levi Z. Leiter were rising junior partners
in their growing business, and here the future heads
of the meat-packing industry were developing their
mighty business. To the country boy from a New
<a class="pagenum" id="page_028" title="28"> </a>
York village, its muddy streets and rows of frame
and brick buildings savored of a metropolis; in its
naked newness he sensed the vital energy that was
so soon to place it among the cities of the world.</p>

  <p class="caption2">Early type of sleeping car. The traveler rarely removed more than his outer clothing, and
oftentimes kept his boots on</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But even during these years of untiring activity
the thought of a radical improvement in railway
car construction was constantly working in the brain
of the young contractor, and in 1858 he determined
to give his ideas the practical test. The story of this
first application of these revolutionizing ideas to the
railroad coaches then in use is best told in the words
of Leonard Seibert, who was at that time an
employee on the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad.</p>

<p class="citation">In 1858 Mr. Pullman came to Bloomington and
engaged me to do the work of remodelling two Chicago
&amp; Alton coaches into the first Pullman sleeping-cars.
The contract was that Mr. Pullman should make all
necessary changes inside of the cars. After looking over
the entire passenger car equipment of the road, which at
that time constituted about a dozen cars, we selected
Coaches Nos. 9 and 19. They were forty-four feet long,
had flat roofs like box cars, single sash windows, of
which there were fourteen on a side, the glass in each
sash being only a little over one foot square. The roof
was only a trifle over six feet from the floor of the car.
Into this car we got ten sleeping-car sections, besides a
linen locker and two washrooms&mdash;one at each end.</p>

<p class="citation"><a class="pagenum" id="page_029" title="29"> </a>
The wood used in the interior finish was cherry.
Mr. Pullman was anxious to get hickory, to stand the
hard usage which it was supposed the cars would receive.
I worked part of the summer of 1858, employing an
assistant or two, and the cars went into service in the
fall of 1858. There were no blue-prints or plans made
for the remodelling of these first two sleeping-cars, and
Mr. Pullman and I worked out the details and measurements
as we came to them. The two cars cost Mr. Pullman
not more than $2,000, or $1,000 each. They were
upholstered in plush, lighted by oil lamps, heated with
box stoves, and mounted on four-wheel trucks with iron
wheels. There was no porter in those days; the brakeman
made up the beds.</p>

<p>In the construction of these first sleeping cars Mr.
Pullman introduced his invention of upper berth
construction by means of which the upper berth
might be closed in the day time and also serve as a
receptacle for bedding. Other improvements and
devices were worked out and tested, and from these
first experiments were drawn the detailed plans from
which the first cars entirely constructed by him were
made. Although without technical training himself,
Mr. Pullman was quick to recognize the necessity
of skilled assistance to express and improve his
embryonic ideas. To this end he soon established
a small workshop, and employing a number of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_030" title="30"> </a>
skilled mechanics set himself to the mastery of the
problems which confronted him.</p>

<p>Another interesting personal reminiscence of the
first days of the Pullman car is afforded by J. L.
Barnes, who was in charge of the first car run from
Bloomington to Chicago over the Chicago &amp; Alton.</p>

<p class="citation">Mr. Pullman had an office on Madison Avenue just
west of LaSalle Street and I boarded with a family very
close to his office. I used to pass his office on my to
meals, and having read in the paper that he was working
on a sleeping car, one day I stopped in and made application
to Mr. Pullman personally for a place as conductor.
I gave him some references and called again and he said
the references were all right and promised me the place.
I made my first trip between Bloomington, Illinois, and
Chicago on the night of September 1, 1859. I was
twenty-two years old at the time. I wore no uniform
and was attired in citizen's clothes. I wore a badge, that
was all. One of my passengers was George M. Pullman,
inventor of the sleeping car.... All the passengers
were from Bloomington and there were no women on the
car that night. The people of Bloomington, little reckoning
that history was being made in their midst, did not
come down to the station to see the Pullman car's first
trip. There was no crowd, and the car, lighted by candles,
moved away in solitary grandeur, if such it might
be called.... I remember on the first night I had to
compel the passengers to take their boots off before they
got into the berths. They wanted to keep them on&mdash;seemed
afraid to take them off.</p>

<p class="citation"><a class="pagenum" id="page_031" title="31"> </a>
The first month business was very poor. People had
been in the habit of sitting up all night in the straight
back seats and they did not think much of trying to sleep
while traveling.... After I had made a few trips it
was decided it did not pay to employ a Pullman conductor,
and the car was placed in charge of the passenger
conductor of the train which carried the sleeping car,
and I was out of a job.</p>

<p class="citation">The first Pullman car was a primitive thing. Beside
being lighted with candles it was heated by a stove at
each end of the car. There were no carpets on the floor,
and the interior of the car was arranged in this way:
There were four upper and four lower berths. The
backs of the seats were hinged and to make up the lower
berth the porter merely dropped the back of the seat
until it was level with the seat itself. Upon this he
placed a mattress and blanket. There was no sheets.
The upper berth was suspended from the ceiling of the
car by ropes and pulleys attached to each of the four
corners of the berth. The upper berths were constructed
with iron rods running from the floor of the car to the
roof, and during the day the berth was pulled up until
it hugged the ceiling, there being a catch which held it
up. At night it was suspended about half-way between
the ceiling of the car and the floor. We used curtains
in front and between all the berths. In the daytime one
of the sections was used to store all the mattresses in.
The car had a very low deck and was quite short. It
had four wheel trucks and with the exception of the
springs under it was similar to the freight car of today.
The coupler was "link and pin;" we had no automatic
brakes or couplers in those days. There was a very
<a class="pagenum" id="page_032" title="32"> </a>
small toilet room in each end, only large enough for one
person at a time. The wash basin was made of tin. The
water for the wash basin came from the drinking can
which had a faucet so that people could get a drink.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The two remodeled Chicago &amp; Alton coaches were
instantly accepted by the public, but despite their
popularity, and the popularity of a third car which
followed them, their originator considered them
merely as experiments and in 1864 plans for the
first actual Pullman car were completed which gave
promise of a car radically different in its construction,
appointments, and arrangement from anything
heretofore attempted. Into this car Pullman
resolutely cast the small capital that he had accumulated;
in its success he placed the unswerving
confidence that characterized his clear vision and
indomitable determination to succeed. This model
car was built in Chicago on the site of the present
Union Station in a shed belonging to the Chicago &amp;
Alton Railroad, at a cost of $18,239.31, without
its equipment, and almost a year was required before
it was ready for service. Fully equipped and
ready for service it represented an investment of
$20,178.14. The "Pioneer" was the name chosen
<a class="pagenum" id="page_033" title="33"> </a>
for its designation, and with the faith that other
cars would soon be required the letter "A" was
added, an indication that even Mr. Pullman's vision
failed to anticipate the possible demand beyond the
twenty-six letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>Never before had such a car been seen; never had
the wildest flights of fancy imagined such magnificence.
Up to the building of the "Pioneer"
$5,000 had represented the maximum that had ever
been spent on a single railroad coach. It was unbelievable
that this $18,000 investment could yield a
remunerative return. The "Pioneer" had improved
trucks with springs reinforced by blocks of solid rubber;
it was a foot wider and two and a half feet
higher than any car then in service, the additional
height being necessary to accommodate the hinged
upper berth of Mr. Pullman's invention. Combined
with its unusual strength, weight, and solidity,
its beauty and the artistic character of its furnishing
and decoration were unprecedented. At one stride
an advance of fifty years had been effected.</p>

<p>A further proof of Mr. Pullman's faith in the
success of the "Pioneer" type of car is illustrated
by the fact that due to its increased height and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_034" title="34"> </a>
breadth the dimensions of station platforms and
bridges at the time of its construction would not permit
its passage over any existing railroad. It is said
that these necessary changes were hastened in the
spring of 1865 by the demand that the new
"Pioneer" be attached to the funeral train which
conveyed the body of President Lincoln from Chicago
to Springfield. In this way one railroad was
quickly adapted to the new requirements, and a few
years later when the "Pioneer" was engaged to take
General Grant on a trip from Detroit to his home
town of Galena, Illinois, another route was opened
to its passage.</p>

<p>Other roads soon made the necessary alterations
to permit the passage of the "Pioneer" and its sister
cars which were now under construction. The
"Pioneer" had, by this time, won wide recognition
and popularity, and a few months later was put in
regular service on the Alton Road. So well were
its dimensions calculated by Mr. Pullman that the
"Pioneer" immediately became the model by which
all railroad cars were measured, and to this day practically
the only changes in dimensions have been in
increased length.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_035" title="35"> </a>
To secure the continuous use of the "Pioneer"
and other similar cars an agreement was effected
between Mr. Pullman and the Chicago &amp; Alton
which marked the beginning of the vast system
which today embraces the entire country and makes
possible continuous and luxurious travel over a large
number of distinct railroads. Thus in the space of
a few years George M. Pullman not only evolved
a type of railroad car luxurious and beautiful in
design and embracing in its construction patents of
great originality and ingenuity, but, in addition,
evolved the rudimentary conception of a system
by which passengers might be carried to any destination
in cars of uniform construction, equipped for

CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subheader">THE RISE OF A GREAT INDUSTRY</span></h2>


<p>The "Pioneer" had cost Mr. Pullman $20,000.
Compared with the finest sleeping cars previously
in use, it was clearly evident that a new
development in luxurious travel had been accomplished.
The best ordinary sleeping cars were
considered expensive at $4,000. There was no more
comparison between the "Pioneer" and its predecessors
in comfort than in cost. But it remained to be
seen what the public would think of it; whether
they preferred luxury, comfort, and real service, to
hardship, discomfort, and no service at a lower cost.</p>

<p>The new cars were larger, heavier, and more substantial
than any previously constructed. Increased
safety was one of their advantages. Moreover, they
were far more beautiful from every aspect&mdash;artistically
painted, richly decorated, and furnished
with fittings for that day remarkable for their elaborate
nature. They were universally admired, and
quickly became the topic of interest among the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_040" title="40"> </a>
traveling public. It is remarkable that at this early
date the two features of the Pullman car which
characterize it today&mdash;the features of safety and
luxury&mdash;should have been so clearly defined.</p>

<p>It is human nature to accept each step forward
as a new standard and it is characteristically American
to refuse to accept an inferior article as soon as
one superior is available, even if at greater cost. The
"Pioneer" and its successors established such a
standard, and immediately those accustomed and
able to afford the increased rate required by the
greater investment in the car, gladly and thankfully
accepted it; while those whose nature usually inclines
to haggling when the purse is touched, were convinced
of the worth of the innovation by the
assurance against disaster which the weight and
strength of the Pullman cars assured.</p>

<p>The next car constructed by Mr. Pullman, after
the "Pioneer" cost $24,000. And very soon after
several additional cars were built at approximately
the same cost, and were put in operation on the
Michigan Central Railroad. Here was the great
test. In these luxurious carriages and in the verdict
of the traveling public rested the future of Mr.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_041" title="41"> </a>
Pullman's project. The question simply resolved
itself to this: Did the public want them? In the
old sleeping cars a berth had cost considerably less
than it was necessary to charge for one in the new
Pullman cars. In the mind of the inventor there
was no question as to the verdict. The railroad
authorities were equally certain the other way.
They did not think the public would pay the extra
sum.</p>

<p>There was but one way to decide, and Mr. Pullman
made the suggestion that both Pullman cars
and old style sleeping cars be operated on the same
train at their respective prices. The results would
show.</p>

<p>What happened is best described in the words of
a contemporary writer.</p>

<p class="citation">Mr. Pullman suggested that the matter be submitted to
the decision of the traveling public. He proposed that
the new cars, with their increased rate, be put on trains
with the old cars at the cheaper rate. If the traveling
public thought the beauty of finish, the increased comfort,
and the safety of the new cars worth $2 per night, there
were the $24,000 cars; if, on the other hand, they were
satisfied with less attractive surroundings at a saving of
50 cents, the cheaper cars were at their disposal. It was
a simple submission without argument of the plain facts
<a class="pagenum" id="page_042" title="42"> </a>
on both sides of the issue&mdash;in other words, an application
of the good American doctrine of appealing to the people
as the court of highest resort.</p>

<p class="citation">The decision came instantly and in terms which left no
opening for discussion. The only travelers who rode in
the old cars were those who were grumbling because they
could not get berths in the new ones. After running
practically empty for a few days, the cars in which the
price for a berth was $1.50 were withdrawn from service,
and Pullmans, wherein the two-dollar tariff prevailed,
were substituted in their places, and this for the very
potent reason, that the public insisted upon it. Nor did
the results stop there. The Michigan Central Railway,
charging an extra tariff of fifty cents per night as compared
with other eastern lines, proved an aggressive competitor
of those lines, not in spite of the extra charge, but
because of it, and of the higher order of comfort and
beauty it represented. Then followed a curious reversal
of the usual results of competition. Instead of a levelling
down to the cheaper basis on which all opposition was
united, there was a levelling up to the standard on which
the Pullman service was planted and on which it stood
out single-handed and alone.</p>

<p class="citation">Within comparatively a short period all the Michigan
Central's rival lines were forced by sheer pressure from
the traveling public to withdraw the inferior and cheaper
cars and meet the superior accommodations and the necessarily
higher tariff. In other words, the inspiration of
that key-note of vigorous ambition for excellence of the
product itself, irrespective of immediate financial returns,
which was struck with such emphasis in the building of
the "Pioneer," and which ever since has rung through all
<a class="pagenum" id="page_043" title="43"> </a>
the Pullman work, was felt in the railroad world of the
United States at that early date, just as it is even more
commonly felt at the present time. At one bound it put
the American railway passenger service in the leadership
of all nations in that particular branch of progress, and
has held it there ever since as an object lesson in the
illustration of a broad and far-reaching
principle.<a id="FNanchor_01" href="#Footnote_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>It will probably be interesting at this point to
describe with some detail the Pullman car of this
early period. In the <i>Daily Illinois State Register</i>,
Springfield, May 26, 1865, appears an interesting
description of one of the new Pioneer type of cars
just installed on the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad.</p>

<p class="citation">To the train on the Chicago, Alton &amp; St. Louis Railroad,
which passed up at noon today, was attached one
of Pullman's improved and beautiful sleeping carriages,
containing a party of excursionists from the Garden
City [Chicago], to whom the trip was complimentarily
extended by the company of the road, and among whom
was George M. Pullman, Esq., of Chicago, the patentee
of the car. This carriage, which we had the pleasure of
inspecting during the stay of the train at our depot, we
found to be the most comfortable and complete in all its
appurtenances, and decidedly superior in many respects to
any similar carriage we have ever seen. It is fifty-four
feet in length by ten in width, and was built at a cost of
$18,000, the painting alone costing upwards of $500.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_044" title="44"> </a>
Besides the berths, sufficient in number to accommodate
upwards of a hundred passengers, there are four state
rooms formed by folding doors, and so constructed with
the berths that the whole can easily be thrown into one
apartment. When the car is not used for sleeping purposes,
as in the day, every appearance of a berth or a bed
is concealed, and in their stead appear the most comfortable
of seats.</p>

<p class="citation">Westlake's patent heating and ventilating apparatus is
applied so that a constant current of pure and pleasant
air is kept in circulation through the car. In fact, it was
useless to attempt to enumerate, in so brief a notice, even
a few of the many improvements which have been introduced
by the patentees into the carriage, rendering it as
they have, superior to any that we have ever inspected.
To one fact, however, we will refer in this connection, as
especially conducive to the comfort of the traveling
public, viz., that a daily change of linen is made in the
berths of this new carriage, thereby keeping them constantly
clean and comfortable, and rendering the car much
more attractive than are similar carriages where this is
neglected. As we are informed by Mr. Pullman that
these cars will hereafter be run on the St. Louis and
Chicago line, we would especially direct the attention of
travelers to the fact, and recommend them to investigate
the matter of our notice for themselves.</p>

<p>Exactly how "upwards of a hundred passengers"
could have been accommodated is hardly clear, but
the enthusiasm of the reporter, fired perhaps by the
luxury of clean linen for each berth each day, may
<a class="pagenum" id="page_045" title="45"> </a>
account for this apparent exaggeration. In the
<i>Illinois Journal</i>, another Springfield paper, of May
30, the reporter reduces the estimate of the capacity
to fifty-two and comments with perhaps more detail
on the decorative features of the car.</p>

<p class="citation">We are reminded by a prophecy which we heard some
three years since&mdash;that the time was not far distant when
a radical change would be introduced in the manner of
constructing railroad cars; the public would travel upon
them with as much ease as though sitting in their parlors,
and sleep and eat on board of them with more ease and
comfort than it would be possible to do on a first-class
steamer. We believed the words of the seer at the time,
but did not think they were so near fulfillment until
Friday last, when we were invited to the Chicago &amp;
Alton depot in this city to examine an improved sleeping-car,
manufactured by Messrs. Field &amp; Pullman, patentees,
after a design by George M. Pullman, Esq., Chicago.</p>

<p>The writer describes his impressions of the interior.
The absence of "mattresses or dingy curtains" by
day, the beauty of the window curtains "looped in
heavy folds," the "French plate mirrors suspended
from the walls," as well as the "several beautiful
chandeliers, with exquisitely ground shades"
hanging from a ceiling "painted with chaste and
elaborate design upon a delicately tinted azure
<a class="pagenum" id="page_046" title="46"> </a>
ground," while the black walnut woodwork and
"richest Brussels carpeting" make the picture complete.
It is small wonder that the Pullman car
excited admiration, and that its first appearance in
the Illinois towns was probably recorded by similar
editorial appreciation.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>But perhaps one of the most interesting insights
into the condition which the new Pullman cars were
so quick to remedy, is found in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,
June 20, 1865. After a veritable eulogy on the
elegance and comfort of the Pullman car, the writer
draws the following enviable contrast.</p>

<p class="citation">It leaves to others to ticket the actual transit, so many
miles for so much money, and comes in with its cars as
the Ticket Agent of Comfort, sells you coupons to rest
and ease by the way. So you wish to go through to New
York or Baltimore, yourself, Belinda, Biddy and the
baby, baskets, bundles, etc? You think of changes of
cars by night, and rushes for seats for your party by day,
of seats foul with the scrapings of dirty boots, of floors
flowing with saliva, of coarse faces and coarse conversation,
of seats you cannot recline in, of the ordinary discomforts
of a long journey by rail!</p>

<p>It is small wonder that the new Pullman cars
found an appreciative welcome!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_047" title="47"> </a>
In 1866 five Pullman sleeping cars were put in
operation on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy
Railroad, and late in May an excursion for several
hundred invited guests was given from Chicago to
Aurora, Illinois, and return. The new cars were
named, "Atlantic," "Pacific," "Aurora," "City of
Chicago," and "Omaha." Occasioned by the comforts
which this new equipment disclosed a current
newspaper remarked:</p>

<p class="citation">Pullman is a benefactor to his kind. The dreaded
journey to New York becomes a mere holiday excursion
in his delightful coaches, and, by the way, he will soon
have a through line from Chicago to New York, in which
a man need never leave his place from one city to the
other.</p>

<p>The year 1867 marks the incorporation of Pullman's
Palace Car Company, for the purpose of the
manufacture and operation of sleeping cars. At
the time of incorporation George M. Pullman owned
all of the sleeping cars on the Michigan Central
Railroad, Great Western [Canada] Railroad, and
the New York Central Railroad lines, a grand total
of forty-eight cars. In the operation of these cars
he was ably assisted by his brother, A. B. Pullman,
who held the office of general superintendent.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_048" title="48"> </a>
In forming the Pullman Company, the founder
aspired to establish an organized system by which
the traveling public might be enabled to travel in
luxurious cars of uniform construction, adapted to
both night and day requirements, without change
between distant points, and over various distinct
lines of railroads. In addition, such a service would
provide the heretofore unknown asset of responsible
employees to whose care might be entrusted women,
children, and invalids. It was a service that was
sorely needed, and indication pointed to its prompt
acceptance by the railroads and the public.</p>

<p>In the same year a remarkable achievement in
railroad travel was accomplished. Due to the different
gauge tracks in use by the several railroads
connecting Chicago and New York, the continuous
passage of a car from one city to the other was
impossible. But in 1867 the standardization of the
gauge was effected by the completion of a third rail
on the Great Western [Canada] Railroad, and to
mark this opening of through communication, an
excursion was arranged from Chicago to New York
on the "Western World," the newest Pullman
"hotel" sleeping car.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_049" title="49"> </a>
At this point it is interesting to note that the first
"hotel car," the "President," was put in service
by the Pullman Company in 1867 on the Great
Western Railroad of Canada. The hotel car was
a combination car, in reality a sleeping car with a
kitchen built in at one end. The meals were served
at tables placed in the sections. To the Pullman
Company, accordingly, must be accorded the credit
of first supplying to the public the service of meals
on board a train. The success of the "President"
led to the immediate construction of the "Western
World" and its sister car "Kalamazoo." These
cars, however, must not be confused with the dining
car which was later developed from the "hotel car"
by the Pullman Company, and to which the "hotel
cars" rapidly gave place.</p>

<p>The <i>Detroit Commercial Advertiser</i> of June 1,
1867, comments:</p>

<p class="citation">But the crowning glory of Mr. Pullman's invention is
evinced in his success in supplying the car with a cuisine
department containing a range where every variety of
meats, vegetables and pastry may be cooked on the car,
according to the best style of culinary art.</p>

<p>The following bill of fare illustrates the variety
of edibles provided on this celebrated excursion.</p>

<p>The excursion party left Chicago on April 8,
1867, and comfortably established in the "Western
<a class="pagenum" id="page_051" title="51"> </a>
World" arrived in Detroit the following day. At
Detroit the river was crossed on the "great iron
ferry boat," the first company of passengers that
ever passed from Chicago to Canada without change
of cars. On the new third rail of the Great Western,
a speed of forty miles was often maintained
for considerable periods. "The cars were decorated
with American and British flags, symbolizing the
union which is destined to take place between the
United States and Canada. A train has just rolled
by, the engine and passenger cars on the broad gauge,
and freight cars from the East on the narrow
gauge." So goes the journal of one of the passengers.</p>

<p>Large crowds visited the train at Rochester, Syracuse,
and Utica, and at Albany, Erastus Corning
telegraphed Commodore Vanderbilt that the car
must be taken to New York, if possible, and the
gauge of the Harlem road be taken for that purpose.
The party arrived in New York on April 14. One
of the purposes of sending the "Western World"
to New York was that it might transport on its
return trip, Dr. J. C. Durant, vice president of the
Union Pacific Road, and a committee of directors,
to examine a portion of their new transcontinental
<a class="pagenum" id="page_052" title="52"> </a>
line which the contractors were ready to turn over.
A member of the party describes the call on Dr.
Durant in his office on Nassau Street and refers to
the office as "probably the finest in New York,
beautiful with paintings and statuary, and enlivened
with the singing of birds."</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p052i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption2">One of the first Pullman cars in which meals were served</p>
</div>

<p>Following the "Western World," the "hotel
cars" were promptly put in service and regular
through service was established between Chicago
and eastern points. The new "City of Boston"
and "City of New York" surpassed even the
"Western World" in magnificence and were popularly
reported to have exceeded $30,000 each in
cost. These cars were known as "hotel cars" for
the reason that each contained all the requirements
for a protracted journey. The main body of the
car was occupied by the berths and seats and at one
end a kitchen and pantry provided the culinary
service. The dining car, devoted entirely to restaurant
purposes, was a second step which soon followed.
The first dining car personally designed
by Mr. Pullman was named the "Delmonico,"
and was operated on the Chicago &amp; Alton in
1868.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_053" title="53"> </a>
But it was in 1869 that the Pullman car made
perhaps its greatest advance in the interest and confidence
of the public for in that year the Union
Pacific, building westward from the Missouri River
at Omaha, met the Central Pacific, which built from
San Francisco eastward. By their union a line was
established between the two coasts of the continent,
a slender thread of track which stretched for 1,848
miles through a practically uninhabited country.
Almost simultaneously with the completion of the
road there was put upon the rails one of the most
superb trains ever turned out of the Pullman shops.
Its journey to California and its reception there were
in the nature of a progressive ovation. From that
time forth the great population of the Pacific coast
knew no train for long distance travel save a Pullman
train, and would hear of no other. When
people from California reached Chicago on their way
eastward, the road over which Pullman cars ran got
their patronage, and roads over which other cars
were operated did not. Newspapers and magazines
were awakened to studies of the Pullman cars and
the Pullman system, and scores of printed pages
were filled with the marvels of a journey to the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_054" title="54"> </a>
Pacific Ocean which was nothing more than a six
days' sojourn in a luxurious hotel, past the windows
of which there constantly flowed a great panorama
of the American continent, thousands of miles in
length and as wide as the eye could reach. Illustrated
magazine articles which appeared telling the
story of a trip to California had as many pictures
of Pullman interiors as they had of the big trees or
the Yosemite Valley. The effect of all this was far
reaching. The great Pennsylvania line abandoned
its own service and adopted the Pullman, and many
other lines made application for inclusion in the
Pullman system.</p>

<p>In May, 1870, the first through train from the
Atlantic to the Pacific crossed the continent, engaged
for a special excursion by the Boston Board of
Trade, many distinguished Bostonians being numbered
among the passengers. During the trip a daily
newspaper entitled the <i>Trans-Continental</i> was published.
In the issue of May 31, published on the
sixth day out, as the train was crossing the summit
of the Sierra Nevadas, an account is given of a meeting
of the passengers in the smoking car, and resolutions
passed by them were printed. The Hon. Alex
<a class="pagenum" id="page_055" title="55"> </a>
H. Rice presided at the meeting, and the resolutions
were offered by Frank H. Peabody, a Boston banker,
and seconded by Robert B. Forbes, another Bostonian.</p>

<p class="citation"><i>Resolved</i>, That we, the passengers of the Boston Board
of Trade Pullman excursion train, the first through train
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, having now been a week
<i>en route</i> for San Francisco, and having had, during this
period, ample opportunity to test the character and quality
of the accommodations supplied for our journey,
hereby express our entire satisfaction with the arrangements
made by Mr. George M. Pullman, and our admiration
of the skill and energy which have resulted in the
construction, equipment and general management of this
beautiful and commodious moving hotel.</p>

<p class="citation"><i>Resolved</i>, That we return our cordial thanks to Mr.
Pullman for the very great pains taken by him beforehand
to make the present journey safe and pleasurable;
that we recognize the complete success which has followed
all his efforts, and that we extend to him our sincere
wishes for such a degree of prosperity to attend all his
operations as will be proportionate to his merits as one
of the most public-spirited, sagacious, and liberal railroad
men of the present day.</p>

<p class="citation"><i>Resolved</i>, That we take pleasure in witnessing, as we
journey from point to point, through all the Western
States, the many evidences of Mr. Pullman's enterprise
and the extent of his operations in the cars which we meet
belonging to the Pullman Company, attached to the regular
trains for the use of the public, or appropriated especially
<a class="pagenum" id="page_056" title="56"> </a>
to private excursion parties, and we earnestly hope
that there will be no delay in placing the elegant and
homelike carriages upon the principal routes in the New
England States, and we will do all in our power to
accomplish this end.</p>

<p>In the next few years the Pullman Palace Car
Company established manufacturing shops in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_058" title="58"> </a>
Detroit, and in 1875 a new "reclining-chair car,"
the first parlor car to be operated in the United
States, was presented by Mr. Pullman to the public.
For several years parlor cars of Pullman design and
construction had been in satisfactory use on the Midland
Railway, between London and Liverpool,
England. The success of these cars promptly
resulted in the construction of the "Maritana" for
use in the United States. The chairs in this new
car were heavily and richly upholstered and revolved
on a swivel, on the same principle as the chairs in the
parlor car of the present day.</p>

CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subheader">THE PULLMAN CAR IN EUROPE</span></h2>


<p>A modest paragraph in many American newspapers
in February, 1873, announced the
momentous news that England was soon to enjoy
the novelty of Pullman transportation&mdash;"The Midland
Railway Company has entered into a contract
with the Pullman Palace Car Company for the
equipment of their road with American drawing
room and sleeping coaches." The Midland was the
longest and most important of three great railroads
which started from London and extended to Liverpool
and Scotland, transversing the rich central
counties of England where so few years before the
coach horn had sounded through the hills. The
adoption of Pullman equipment by this prominent
railroad was singularly conspicuous.</p>

<p>On February 15, 1873, at a "half-yearly meeting
of the shareholders of the Midland Railway,"
Mr. Pullman personally addressed the officers of
the company. It appears that Mr. Allport, the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_062" title="62"> </a>
general manager of the Midland Railway, on a
recent visit to the United States and Canada, had
been greatly impressed by the accommodations
afforded the traveling public, and had made a particular
study of the Pullman cars. Acting on his
advice the directors invited Mr. Pullman to England
to appear before the meeting. Mr. Pullman proposed
that the Midland Company should authorize
the speedy construction of carriages particularly
adapted to their requirements, and a motion was
carried to authorize the construction of such cars on
the basic Pullman principles. It was accordingly
agreed that eighteen new cars should be constructed
in America and shipped to England in August and
that Mr. Pullman should return to England at that
time to superintend their installation.</p>

<p>By the contract the Pullman Company agreed to
furnish as many dining-room, drawing-room, and
sleeping cars as the demands of the traveling public
required, without charge to the road, its
compensation being in the extra fare paid for use of
the cars. The road, on the other hand, received its
compensation in the free use of the cars, in return
for which it guaranteed to the Pullman Company
<a class="pagenum" id="page_063" title="63"> </a>
the exclusive right to furnish such cars for fifteen
years. As in America, the porters, conductors, cooks,
waiters and other attendants were hired by the Pullman
Company. Two night trains and two day
trains of American cars only, were to be put on at
the start. The contract was not exclusive, and other
English railroads watched with interest the working
out of the American innovation.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Pullman car at home and
abroad quite naturally inspired a host of imitators.
Among the first was Colonel W. D. Mann, the proprietor
of the <i>Mobile Register</i>, who designed a
sleeping car embodying certain characteristic Pullman
features, but divided transversely into compartments
or "boudoirs," each entered directly from
the sides, and connected by a private door permitting
the passage of the attendant to and through the
several compartments. Each compartment contained
seats for four persons, which by night could
be made up into beds. The design was ingenious but
failed in many vital respects to compete with the
greater comfort and roominess of the Pullman car.</p>

<p>As the Pullman car was the first sleeping car to be
installed for regular service in England, so credit
<a class="pagenum" id="page_064" title="64"> </a>
should be given to Colonel Mann for affording the
first sleeping car for public service ever operated on
the Continent. Mann's "Boudoir Cars" were
installed on the Vienna and Munich line in 1873,
and their favorable reception and popularity unquestionably
went far to better the trying conditions of
European travel.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <p class="caption2">Interior of a Pullman car used about 1880. Here a tendency to
ornamentation begins to show. Note the low-backed seats</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Designed in America and introduced on the continent,
the Mann boudoir cars enjoyed an almost
unoccupied field in Europe, with the exception of
England, where the railway managers had adopted
the Pullman cars as their standard. The Mann car
was developed to suit European railroads and
European wants. A Belgian company was organized
to introduce sleeping cars by contracts with
railroad companies, somewhat like those of the Pullman
Company in America. The Mann cars which
were put in service in the United States between
Boston and New York in 1883 were divided into
eight compartments, some accommodating two persons,
some four. The seats were arranged transversely
instead of longitudinally. Due to their
smaller passenger capacity a higher rate was necessarily
charged than for Pullman accommodations.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_065" title="65"> </a>
But exclusive possession of the Continental field
was not left to Colonel Mann undisputed, for during
the year 1875 Mr. Pullman established a shop at
Turin, Italy, and under the direction of a Mr. A.
Rapp, who was sent on from the Detroit works, a
number of cars were constructed for use on through
trains on the principal Italian lines. The following
testimonial presented to Mr. Rapp at the conclusion
of the work by the men who had been employed
expresses, although in none too polished English,
their appreciation of the work that had been provided
them.</p>

<p class="fontsmall"><i>Turin</i>, 10 January 1876.</p>
</div>

<p class="margtop2">The appearance of the new Pullman cars in England
created immediate and favorable comment, for
not only were the cars radical in the service which
they afforded, but their construction, following the
advanced principles of American car building, offered
sharp contrast to the less modern cars of
English construction. From the most gorgeous first-class
carriage down to the dumpiest begrimed coal
car, all British railway conveyances rested on four
iron wheels, placed in the position where Artemus
Ward located the legs of the horse&mdash;one at each
corner. Until the Pullman sleepers were introduced
into Britain, the sight of a car resting on eight
<a class="pagenum" id="page_067" title="67"> </a>
wheels was unprecedented, as no one thought of
doubting the entire security from danger of a carriage
with only four points of support. Indeed, the conservative
Briton saw no more real necessity for a
railway carriage having eight wheels than for a horse
to have more than four legs.</p>

<p>Under arrangements with the Great Northern
Railway, Pullman "dining room" carriages were
put in service on November 1, 1879, between Leeds
and King's Cross Station, London. Luncheon and
dinner were served and the menu included "soups,
fish, entrees, roast joints, puddings and fruits for
dessert," a truly English bill of fare. The reception
of this innovation is described by the <i>London Telegraph</i>,
which concluded a comment on the dining
car with this friendly suggestion:</p>

<p class="citation">If the British public can be brought to give this new
refreshment-car system, just inaugurated by the Great
Northern Railway, a fair trial, there will be another
traveling infliction, besides Dyspepsia and Discontent,
which will be speedily laid in the Red Sea. I mean the
ghost of Ennui. Luncheon or dinner on board a Pullman
palace-car will surely banish Boredom from railway
journeys.</p>

<p>By the year 1879 Pullman sleeping and drawing
room cars were in operation on three English and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_068" title="68"> </a>
three Scotch lines, and at the invitation of the
Italian Government, cordially responded to by the
Pullman Palace Car Company, sleeping cars, similar
to those in use in England on the Midland and Great
Northern railways were put in weekly service between
Brindisi and Bologna, in connection with the
steamers of the Peninsula and Oriental Company.
At Bologna the service was taken up by the Belgian
"Societe Anonyme des Wagons Lits"&mdash;an interesting
recognition by a foreign government of the
superiority of the American railway carriages.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1888 "The Pullman Limited Express" began
regular service on the London, Brighton, &amp; South
Coast Line, between Victoria Station and Brighton.
Single cars of the American pattern had been running
on this line for five or six years, but in this
train for the first time the English public was offered
a "solid Pullman" equipment. Four cars comprised
the train&mdash;a parlor car, a drawing room car with
ladies' boudoir and dining room, a restaurant car,
and a smoking car, while a compartment at each end
of the train next to the luggage compartment was
provided for servants. On this train electric lighting
was first employed by the Pullman Company for
<a class="pagenum" id="page_069" title="69"> </a>
illuminating railroad cars&mdash;a particular feature that
received wide advertisement.</p>

<p>The London, Brighton, &amp; South Coast Railway
opened the New Year of 1889 with the first "vestibule"
train that had ever greeted the eyes of foreign
travelers. Three Pullman cars, "Princess,"
"Prince," and "Albert Victor," were regularly attached
to a train of three first-class cars. The Pullman
cars were built at the Pullman plant at Detroit,
Michigan, and were shipped in sections to England.
By this innovation Yankee genius again demonstrated
its leadership, and the travelers of a distant
nation profited by the genius and energy of an American
inventor.</p>

<p>The Pullman Company, Limited, of England, existed
as a property of the American company until
the year 1906, when, due to the enormous development
of the system in the United States, it was
deemed wise for economic reasons to separate the
two companies. But today the British company
still proudly bears the name of Pullman, a tribute
to the inventive genius, untiring energy, and wide
vision of a country boy of the new world.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page_073" title="73"> </a>
CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subheader">THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST</span></h2>


<p>One of the most interesting elements in the
history of the Pullman car and the Pullman
Company is the story of imitation and competition
which for a period after the foundation of the parent
company thrived and later disappeared. The success
of the Pullman car necessarily brought competition.
It was wholesome that such competition should arise.
If a car more convenient than the car of Mr. Pullman's
invention could be devised, it was right that
it should be given the test of public opinion. That
no car constructed along different basic lines survived,
established the right of the Pullman car to its
preeminence. That certain cars patterned after Mr.
Pullman's basic ideas, and in most cases directly infringing
on his patents, received a degree of popularity
again reflects creditably to the Pullman car.</p>

<p>Distinct from the innovations afforded by Pullman
car construction, the universal service of the
Company afforded the public a new service of equal
<a class="pagenum" id="page_074" title="74"> </a>
value. Where formerly it was necessary for the
traveler to change from car to car whenever and
wherever one railroad connected with another line,
the uniform service of the Pullman Company created
a new and infinitely more desirable situation, for it
was now possible to travel without inconvenience or
interruption between practically any two points in
the country regardless of the number of different
railroads over whose tracks the traveler's ticket required
passage. By competition, the value of such
a service was tested; tested alike by the individual
railroads and their patrons. That each and every
competing company ultimately retired from the field,
and that practically every railroad in the United
States has today contracted with the Pullman Company
for its standardized service, is tacit recognition
to the worth of the service rendered.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <div class="frame maxwidth32">
  <p class="caption2">More ornate interiors. (1) early Pullman parlor car; (2) old type
Pullman sleeping car</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are still other reasons why the control of
sleeping and parlor service should be delegated to a
single company. Due to the vast area embraced by
the boundaries of the United States and the wide
range of climate which these boundaries contain,
there are many railroads which require during certain
months of the year a larger number of cars to transport
<a class="pagenum" id="page_075" title="75"> </a>
their through passengers than in others. Other
roads require an equally great number of sleeping and
parlor cars during other months, as for instance those
roads which carry the winter tourists to the South and
Southwest in winter as opposed to the roads which
feel the peak of passenger travel in summer when
the vacationists are headed for the Atlantic coast
resorts or the northwestern mountains. Again, there
are special occasions, like great conventions, when
the railroads touching the convention city must
have hundreds of sleeping cars above their normal
needs.</p>

<p>Few railroads could afford to tie up capital in the
cars required for such brief periods of demand; it
would be an economic fallacy to pass the expense of
the maintenance and constant replacement of such
an equipment on to the public. To meet this situation
is the mission of the Pullman Company.</p>

<p>Of the numerous sleeping car companies the Gates
Sleeping Car Company was perhaps the earliest.
This car was named after Mr. G. B. Gates, General
Manager of the Lake Shore Road, and with the
consolidation of the Hudson River Railroad and the
New York Central in 1869, these cars, previously
<a class="pagenum" id="page_076" title="76"> </a>
only operated on the Lake Shore, were put in the
New York, Buffalo, Chicago service.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <div class="frame maxwidth24">
  <p class="caption2">The latest Pullman parlor car, showing simplicity of modern car

  </div>
</div>

<p>Among the various competitors of the Pullman
Company, the Wagner Palace Car Company, which
succeeded, in 1865, the New York Central Sleeping
Car Company, and absorbed in 1869 the Gates
Sleeping Car Company, developed by far the widest
and most formidable competition and continued its
service over the longest period. The underlying
reasons for the strength of this competition lay primarily
in the fact that the Wagner cars followed
more closely the Pullman characteristics, and in
fact the infringement of certain basic Pullman patents
by the Wagner Company was a cause of
frequent litigation over a period of many years.
Webster Wagner, the founder of the Wagner Palace
Car Company, began his career as a wagon
maker. The first cars which he constructed had
a single tier of berths, and the bedding was packed
away by day in a closet at the end of the car. Commodore
Vanderbilt backed Wagner and became
interested in his company, a connection which gave
Wagner invaluable assistance and a hold on the
sleeping-car business of the lines controlled by the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_077" title="77"> </a>
Vanderbilt interests, a connection which enabled
him for many years to be a keen competitor of the
Pullman Company.</p>

<p>Early in June, 1881, suit was brought by the
Pullman Palace Car Company against the New York
Central Sleeping Car Company and Webster Wagner,
claiming $1,000,000 damages for infringement
and use of patents in the construction and use of
Wagner sleeping coaches. The bill stated that in
1870 the Wagner Company began building sleeping
cars, and for several years its coaches ran only on
the New York Central Railroad and its various
branches. The company finding it impossible to
build satisfactory cars without using the Pullman
patents, contracted with the Pullman Company to
use certain of its patented improvements. This arrangement
was made with the distinct understanding
that the Wagner Company was to run its cars only
over the New York Central Railroad. For five years
this arrangement was satisfactorily carried out. But
in 1875 the Pullman Company's contract with the
Michigan Central Railroad expired and the Wagner
Company secured the contract to run the cars between
Detroit and Chicago, thus making a through
<a class="pagenum" id="page_078" title="78"> </a>
connection for the Vanderbilt lines between New
York and Chicago.</p>

<p>By this new routing of the Wagner cars direct
from New York to Chicago and the elimination of the
Pullman cars from the Chicago and Detroit service,
an opportunity offered for some other road to avail
itself of the Pullman service and effect a through
Pullman service between New York and Chicago.</p>

<p>The Erie was the road that grasped the opportunity.
By arrangements with the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio and several other roads, through Erie trains
between New York and Chicago, comprising Pullman
hotel coaches, sleeping cars and drawing room
cars were put in service on November 1, 1875. A
circular published in Chicago announcing the new
arrangement said:</p>

<p class="citation">From the first of November, the Pullman hotel and
drawing room coaches, for many years so popular on the
Michigan Central line, will be withdrawn from that
route, and with new and increased improvements will
thereafter run exclusively on the Erie and Chicago line,
forming the first and only Pullman hotel coach line
between Chicago and New York.</p>

<p>The success of the new Erie Pullman coaches was
immediately assured. The hotel cars especially were
a great attraction. These were divided into two
<a class="pagenum" id="page_079" title="79"> </a>
compartments, in one of which the kitchen was
located, the other compartment being utilized as a
sleeping car. First-class meals, including all manner
of game and seasonable delicacies, were served on
movable tables placed in the sections. In fact, the
<i>New York Tribune</i>, in commenting on the new Pullman
equipment, asked: "Should the Erie have a
monopoly of such comforts? Why does not Wagner
imitate or improve upon Pullman?"</p>

<p>These cars were nicknamed "French Flats."</p>

<p class="citation">All the modern conveniences of a first-class house are
condensed into one of these hotels on wheels. The beds
at night are put away to make room for spacious seats
by day, between which a table is placed, covered with
damask cloths and napkins folded in quaint devices, at
which four may sit with ease. The whole car&mdash;a Pullman&mdash;is
luxuriously fitted up, and one end is partitioned
into a storeroom and kitchen; there is a smoking-room
for lovers of the weed, and a separate toilet room for
ladies. As the porter of the car blackens the boots, and
there is a telegraph office at each stopping place, the
waggish question of "Where is the barber shop?" is often
made. But this may come, too, as last summer an excursion
party of ladies and gentlemen took a hair-dresser
with them over the Erie to Niagara Falls, and two or
three ladies actually <i>had their hair crimped</i> while traveling
thirty or forty miles an hour! At this time, while
game is plenty in the West, the Pullmans, with their
<a class="pagenum" id="page_080" title="80"> </a>
facilities, and two fast trains each way per day, are able
to make a bill of fare and serve it in a style which would
cause Delmonico to wring his hands in anguish. The
service is on the European plan; that is, you pay for what
you order, and we give the prices of the principal articles,
to show at what a reasonable rate one can take a superior
meal of fifty or a hundred miles long: Prairie chicken,
pheasant, and woodcock, whole, $1; snipe, quail, golden
plover and blue-winged teal, each 75 cents; venison, 60
cents; chicken, whole, 75 cents; cold tongue, ham, and
corned beef, 30 cents; sardines, lobster, and broiled ham
or bacon, 40 cents; mutton and lamb chops, veal cutlets, or
half a chicken, 50 cents; sirloin steak, 50 cents, &amp;c. Every
traveler who has missed his dinner to catch a train will
rejoice in knowing that a warm meal awaits him at the
cars, and that he can wake up in the morning and choose
his time for breakfast, instead of bolting it down at the
twenty minutes' convenience of the railroad
company.<a id="FNanchor_02" href="#Footnote_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Some time prior to 1861 sleeping cars were being
operated over the Camden &amp; Amboy and Baltimore
&amp; Ohio railroads. These cars were known as
"Knight" cars, after their designer, E. C. Knight.
The "Knights" were built at a cost of about
$7,000, and were regarded as the handsomest things
on wheels. As in the bunk cars, all of which found
their model in the sleeping arrangements of the canal
boat, the berths were only on one side of the car and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_081" title="81"> </a>
consisted of a triple tier of two double and one single
berth; an arrangement later changed to one double
and two single berths.</p>

<p>The Woodruff sleeping car also was designed
about this time by T. T. Woodruff, Master Car
Builder of the Terre Haute &amp; Alton Railroad. In
this car both sides of the car were utilized as in
the Pullman car, and the sleeping accommodations
consisted of twelve sections, six on a side. A company
was formed to operate the Woodruff cars in
1871, with a capital of $100,000.</p>

<p>The Flower Sleeping Car Company was another
characteristic competitor. This short-lived company
was organized in 1882 in Bangor, Maine, with a
capital of $500,000. The seats in this new car were
placed in the middle instead of on the sides of the
cars, thus leaving an aisle on each side instead of one
in the center. Claims were made that a freer circulation
of air would result, and a news item of the
<i>Times</i> further recommended this unique construction
as more convenient to families, the berths being so
arranged, side by side, that two could be made up
into a double bed.</p>

<p>Mann's Boudoir Car Company was incorporated
<a class="pagenum" id="page_082" title="82"> </a>
in 1883, with a capital of $1,000,000, and experienced
considerable popularity due to their unique
arrangement, which has been described in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>In 1883 the Erie Railroad realized the long entertained
ambition of entering Chicago on its own rails.
To accomplish this, the Erie had leased the New
York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio Railroad and built the
Chicago &amp; Atlantic. Through connection was actually
made May 15, on which date freight traffic was
begun.</p>

<p>The train by which the Erie inaugurated the passenger
business over the new trunk line was probably
the most complete and elegant train ever to that
time constructed. All of the cars were of Pullman
manufacture and consisted of a baggage car, second-class
coach, a smoking car, and first-class coaches and
sleepers that were "models of perfection and beauty,
as might be expected where the Pullman Company
had <i>carte blanche</i> to produce the best possible."
Each coach was lighted with the new Pintsch lights.
The smoking car deserves more than passing mention,
for it was the first one ever constructed of
Pullman standard. The car was equipped with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_083" title="83"> </a>
upholstered easy chairs, and a "refreshment buffet"
moistened the throats of the smokers.</p>

<p>Early in 1889 the Pullman Company acquired the
control of the Mann Boudoir Car Company and the
Woodruff Sleeping Car Company, including the entire
car equipment and plants. By this acquisition
a long step was taken for the unification of sleeping
car service, and the further development of a uniform
and widely extended scope of operations. For
years the success of the Pullman Company's service
had been too generally acknowledged to escape the
notice of enterprising railroad men, and these two
companies were fair examples of the numerous competing
companies that were organized. But the success
of the Pullman service was based on an idea
of too wide conception ever to be successfully imitated.
The success of the company engendered competition;
its success resulted only in a comparison
of service injurious to the imitators. Behind all this
lay the fundamental reason for Pullman supremacy.
Created to give a standardized service everywhere
for the convenience of travelers, it was quickly apparent
that competition was but a reversal to the old
order&mdash;the more companies, the less uniform service.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_084" title="84"> </a>
About a month previous, the Mann Boudoir Company
and the Woodruff Sleeping Car Company had
joined hands and formed the Union Palace Car
Company. By the purchase of this combine the
Pullman Company added about 15,000 miles of road
to that already operated, and by that many miles
extended its through car service. The only remaining
sleeping car companies of any importance outside
of the Pullman Company were the Wagner Company,
belonging to the Vanderbilts, and operated
over the Vanderbilt lines, and the Monarch Sleeping
Car Company, which operated entirely in the New
England States with the exception of one Ohio line.
A newspaper of the time commented on the merger,
and closed with the verdict: "While this will add
to the volume of the Pullman business, it will also
render the service upon the absorbed lines far more
efficient and satisfactory for the traveling public."</p>

</div>

<p>In 1888, Mr. Pullman had put in operation his
vestibule trains, which immediately met with extraordinary
favor and patronage. In a very few
days the Wagner Company also advertised a vestibule
train and were promptly met with an injunction
holding the Wagner appliances to be an infringement
<a class="pagenum" id="page_085" title="85"> </a>
of the Pullman patent. After another hearing,
the injunction was superseded, the Wagner Company
giving an unlimited bond, signed by the Vanderbilts,
to pay any damages ascertained by the courts.</p>

<p>After months occupied in taking the evidence of
travelers, expert mechanics, railroad officials, prominent
citizens, and others, a final hearing was had.
The judges, owing to the vast interests involved and
the legal difficulties presented, took ample time for
consideration, but finally adhered to their first conclusion.
The main feature of the Pullman vestibule
system was the Sessions patent, without which the
vestibule system was worthless. The court declared
this invention to be of the highest order of utility,
not only as shown by the testimony in the ease and
the adoption of the patent by the principal railroads
of the country, but also by the acts of the Wagner
Company in appropriating the device, and in the
tenacity with which they clung to it in the courts
under an immense bond for any damages to result,
and so, in April, 1889, the United States Circuit

CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subheader">THE TOWN OF PULLMAN</span></h2>


<p>Like most other industries, the Pullman Palace
Car Company felt the effect of the financial
depression immediately following 1873, but the reaction
followed, and on the resumption of specie
payments in 1879 dawned a new era in the Company's
history and a rapid expansion of its business.
To meet this expansion and to extend the business
still farther along the line of general car building,
it became necessary to enlarge the plant. The shops
already established in St. Louis, Detroit, Elmira,
and Wilmington were unable to provide the volume
required by the increasing demand for the Company's
output. It was evident that new shops must
be built on a larger and more comprehensive scale
than any that had gone before.</p>

<p>In 1879 the Chicago newspapers were alert to confirm
the rumor that George M. Pullman was planning
to locate his new shops at Chicago. The
following year the rumor became fact and the question
<a class="pagenum" id="page_090" title="90"> </a>
of the exact location became of paramount
interest.</p>

<p>Chicago with its central position with reference
to the railway systems of the continent, seemed the
natural site, but there were weighty objections,
touching both finance and the matter of labor, to be
urged against building within the city limits proper.
Sites were visited by representatives of the Company
at Hinsdale, Illinois, and Wolf Lake, Indiana, but
in April it was definitely announced that the works
would be located on the Illinois Central Railroad on
the shore of Lake Calumet. A Chicago newspaper
commented on the decision of the Company as follows:</p>

<p class="citation">A notable addition to Chicago's mercantile industry is
to be the extensive car works of the Pullman Palace Car
Company, ground for which is to be broken today. A
larger establishment for manufacturing purposes will not
exist in the West, and while it will contain all the latest
and most improved mechanical appliances in use, it will
embody in its architecture grace and beauty that is quite
characteristic of the palace car. The works are to cost
$1,000,000; about 2,000 men are to be employed in them,
and the extended arrangement of machinery is to be
moved by the Corliss engine, one of the Centennial wonders,
which has been purchased by the Pullmans.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_091" title="91"> </a>
An interesting personal reminiscence of this famous
real estate operation may be found in Frederick
Francis Cook's <i>Bygone Days in Chicago</i>.</p>

<p class="citation">Another "Pullman scoop" was of an extraordinary
real-estate and manufacturing interest when "negotiated"&mdash;the
slang to be accepted for once in its proper
meaning. In the later seventies, besides other duties, I
had charge of the real-estate department of the <i>Times</i>.
It became known that the Pullman Company intended to
build a manufacturing town somewhere, but whether in
the environs of Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, or other
western point, was for the public an open question for
many months&mdash;and, I dare say, for a time was an unsettled
proposition with the company itself, for St. Louis
offered large inducements in the way of land grants.
What finally turned the scales in favor of Chicago,
according to Mr. Pullman's declaration to me, was the
more favorable climatic conditions presented by Chicago.
It was his contention that during the summer a man
could do at least ten per cent more work near Lake Michigan
than in the Mississippi Valley in the latitude of
St. Louis.</p>

<p class="citation">During many disturbing weeks&mdash;for the whole real-estate
market in at least three cities waited on the decision&mdash;frequent
announcements were made that the
directors of the company, or its committee on site, had
inspected this locality, or that, in the vicinity of one city
or another, and so the wearisome time went on. Many
places were visited about Chicago&mdash;some to the north,
some on the Desplaines, some in the neighborhood of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_092" title="92"> </a>
Canal, but somehow none near Calumet Lake, a fact
which finally aroused my suspicions. In the meantime,
unverifiable reports of large transactions in that locality
floated about in real-estate circles. Finally, I pinned
down an actual sale of large dimensions, with Colonel
"Jim" Bowen as the ostensible purchaser. That opened
my eyes, for the colonel's circumstances at this time put
such a transaction on his own account altogether out of
the question.</p>

<p class="citation">Almost daily at this time Mr. Pullman was interviewed
on the situation by the real-estate newspaper
phalanx&mdash;Henry D. Lloyd was then in charge for the
<i>Tribune</i>&mdash;but "nothing decided," was the stereotyped
reply. By and by I discovered that almost invariably if
I went at a certain hour, "Colonel Jim" would be largely
in evidence about the Pullman headquarters, with an air
of doing a "land-office business," and, as it turned out,
he was actually doing something very much like it.
Slowly I picked up clue after clue, pieced this to that,
and one day felt in a position to say to Mr. Pullman that
I had located the site. He seemed amused, and laughingly
replied that he was pleased to hear it, as it would
save the committee on site a lot of trouble; and, as some
of them were that very day looking at a Desplaines River
site near Riverside&mdash;a trip most ostentatiously advertised
in advance&mdash;he thought he would telegraph them
to stop looking, and come back to town.</p>

<p class="citation">It was always a pleasure to interview Mr. Pullman, for
he had a way of making you feel at ease, and I entered
heartily into the humor of his jocularity. But, as in a
bantering way, I let out link after link of my chain of
evidence, he became more and more serious, and finally&mdash;without
<a class="pagenum" id="page_093" title="93"> </a>
committing himself, however&mdash;took the ground
that even if true, in view of the importance of their plans,
no paper having the good of Chicago at heart ought by
premature publication to interfere with them. He
pressed this point more and more, and finally made frank
confession that I was on the right track, by acknowledging
that they had already bought many hundreds of
acres, were negotiating for many hundreds more which
would be advanced to prohibitive prices by publication,
and the whole scheme would thus be wrecked. On the
other hand, if I withheld publication, he promised that I
should have the matter exclusively&mdash;the whole vast
improvement scheme, unique plan of administration, etc.
As there was the danger in waiting that one of my rivals
might get hold of the facts, exploit them, and thus turn
the tables on me, I replied that the matter was of too
great moment for me to take the responsibility of holding
the news, and that I should have to consult Mr. Storey.
It happened that Mr. Storey had invested quite extensively
in South Side boulevard property; and, as a great
improvement southward could not fail to add to the value
of his holding, and there was the further prospect of a
more complete exclusive account later than was possible
with my skeleton information, he gave a ready assent.</p>

<p>The town of Pullman meant far more in the mind
of its founder than a mere industrial establishment.
The dreary, water-soaked prairie was raised to high,
dry land; an entire town was planned and blocked
out following Mr. Pullman's own design. Architects
<a class="pagenum" id="page_094" title="94"> </a>
and landscape architects worked together to carry
out the plan to a harmonious and pleasing fulfillment.
Among the more prominent details of this
vast work were included a system by which the
sewage of the town was collected and pumped far
away to the Pullman produce farm; the equipment
of every house and flat regardless of rental with the
most modern appliances of water, gas, and plumbing;
the establishment of athletic fields; the concentration
of the merchandising of the town under the glass
roof of the central arcade building, and the construction
of a handsome market house, a fine schoolhouse
to accommodate a thousand pupils, a library containing
over 8,000 volumes, a savings bank and a large
and artistically decorated theater. The population
of Pullman in January, 1881, counted four souls.
In February, 1882, there were 2,084 inhabitants, a
total which had increased to 8,203 by September,
1884.</p>

<p>A contemporary writer closes an enthusiastic description
of the town of Pullman with the following
paragraph:</p>

<p class="citation">Imagine a perfectly equipped town of 12,000 inhabitants,
built out from one central thought to a beautiful
<a class="pagenum" id="page_095" title="95"> </a>
and harmonious whole. A town that is bordered with
bright beds of flowers and green velvety stretches of
lawn; that is shaded with trees and dotted with parks
and pretty water vistas, and glimpses here and there of
artistic sweeps of landscape gardening; a town where
the homes, even to the most modest, are bright and wholesome
and filled with pure air and light; a town, in a
word, where all that is ugly, and discordant, and demoralizing,
is eliminated, and all that inspires to self-respect,
to thrift and to cleanliness of person and of thought is
generously provided. Imagine all this, and try to picture
the empty, sodden morass out of which this beautiful
vision was reared, and you will then have some idea of
the splendid work, in its physical aspects at least, which
the far-reaching plan of Mr. Pullman has
wrought.<a id="FNanchor_03" href="#Footnote_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page_099" title="99"> </a>
CHAPTER VII<br/>

<span class="subheader">INVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS</span></h2>


<p>The invention of the folding upper berth combination
by Mr. Pullman was the first of many
contributions by himself, and in later years by the
Pullman Company and those associated with it, to the
development of railway travel. Sleeping cars for
a number of years had given night accommodations
to travelers; there was nothing new in the idea that
a night journey required sleeping accommodations.
But in the new and radical berth construction devised
by Mr. Pullman lay the difference between
impracticability and practicability&mdash;between discomfort
and luxury.</p>

<p>The earliest sleeping cars were mere bunk cars in
which the male passengers might recline during the
night hours. Later, bedding was furnished, but the
necessity of storing it by day in a closet at the end
of the cars created a situation in which order and
cleanliness were far from practicable. By the Pullman
invention, however, all this was changed. A
<a class="pagenum" id="page_100" title="100"> </a>
type of car was developed that was not only comfortable
and convenient for day travel, but one that
might be quickly transformed into a comfortable
sleeping apartment. Furthermore, the new upper
berth construction made it possible to pack away by
day the entire bedding, mattresses, curtains, and
partitions necessary to convert each section into a
double sleeping apartment.</p>

<p>With this simple mechanical innovation the inventor
combined an idea characterized by a breadth
of vision that ranks with the great ideas of the century.
In few words, he conceived the thought that
it would be possible at one stroke to supplant the
inadequate and inefficient service of the day with a
new service so complete in its comforts and conveniences
that no one might express a wish that the
service might be unable to fulfill.</p>

</div>

<p>It is interesting, in passing, to consider the fact
that up to the development of the Pullman car,
night trains were patronized exclusively by men, for
no woman would have considered subjecting herself
to the inconvenience and lack of privacy of the
ordinary sleeping car. The development of the Pullman
car and Pullman service made continuous day
<a class="pagenum" id="page_101" title="101"> </a>
and night travel practical for women and children;
it created the comforts and privacies they naturally
required. To be sure it was several years before the
new order of things received general recognition, but
the public quickly caught on. "Travel by Pullman"
soon became a popular diversion.</p>

<p>The story of the early years of the Pullman sleeping
car has been told in the foregoing chapters. Due
in large measure to the comfort and convenience of
the cars, continuous travel lengthened, and at once
arose the necessity for eating as well as sleeping
accommodations on the through long-distance trains.</p>

<p>For a number of years foreign travelers in America
had praised the elaborate restaurant service afforded
by certain station eating-houses. Towns developed
keen rivalry in respect to the meals provided by their
station "counters," and the station restaurants of
certain towns developed among constant travelers a
reputation for unusual culinary excellence. Our
fathers will doubtless recall the glorious fame of
dining rooms at Poughkeepsie, Springfield, and Altoona,
and of certain dishes that enjoyed nation-wide
reputation and might be had only at this or that particular
station restaurant.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_102" title="102"> </a>
But, on the other hand, the uninviting, indigestible
nature of the so-called refreshment offered at some
railway eating stations had long been a byword. In
most sections of the country it was practically impossible
to procure a respectable meal or lunch while
traveling. Railway officials had wrestled with the
subject in vain. Recognizing the fact that the heart
of the railway traveler is most susceptible to influences
reaching it by way of his stomach, they
made repeated and continued endeavors to improve
the fare offered during the "twenty minutes for
dinner" stops. With a few exceptions the results
were not encouraging, and the traveling public continued
its dyspeptic round three times a day.</p>

<p>The station eating-house was on an unsound basis,
and its disadvantages were obvious. With the increase
of the speed of through trains and the demand
for shorter running times between terminals it became
quickly apparent that a train could not be
stopped three times a day to permit the passengers
to gorge a hasty meal at the station restaurant.
Three meals at a minimum of twenty minutes each
was an hour lost, and twenty minutes for eating
was as bad for the passenger as it was for the running
<a class="pagenum" id="page_103" title="103"> </a>
time of the trains. There were still other disadvantages.
In addition to the delay of the train and
the tax on the passenger's digestion, there was the
frequent discomfort of wet or wintry weather. On
a fine day it was well enough to "stretch one's legs,"
but in rain or snow the tri-daily evacuation of the
car was a decidedly unpopular feature.</p>

<p>The installation of "hotel-car" service by the
Pullman Company sang the knell of the station
eating-counter. The "President," a car combining
sleeping and eating accommodations, was put in
service in 1867 on the Grand Trunk Railway, then
the Great Western of Canada. Its instant success
necessitated the building of the "Kalamazoo" and
"Western World," and in the years immediately following
many hotel cars were put in service.</p>

<p>The second step in the evolution was inevitable.
At best, the hotel car was only a sleeping car with
restaurant accommodations. Eating and sleeping
have never been associated in the modern mind;
there must be a separate place for each.</p>

<p>To meet the demand, or rather to anticipate a demand
which his keen eyes foresaw, Mr. Pullman set
himself to the task of developing a car which would
<a class="pagenum" id="page_104" title="104"> </a>
be only a dining car, serving no other purpose, and
practical for operation in conjunction with through
trains of the fastest speed. The first real dining
car which Mr. Pullman constructed was aptly named
the "Delmonico." It was a complete restaurant
with a large kitchen and pantries at one end. The
main body of the car was fitted up as a dining room
in which the passengers from all the cars of the train
could enter and take their meals with entire comfort.
The "Delmonico" was put in regular service in 1868
on the Chicago &amp; Alton, and other Pullman diners
were added the same year. At about the same time
the Michigan Central and the Chicago, Burlington
&amp; Quincy Railroads also began to operate dining
cars on their trains. To the Chicago &amp; Alton, however,
belongs the honor of having first inaugurated
the dining-car system. The Michigan Central and
Burlington did not put on dining cars until 1875.
The Chicago &amp; Alton dining cars were run between
Chicago and St. Louis, and were constructed and
managed by Mr. Pullman. The price for a meal
was $1.00. Later the Alton acquired an interest
in the dining cars, and finally assumed full control
of them.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_105" title="105"> </a>
Although founded and developed, and for a number
of years successfully operated by the Pullman
Company, the dining car is no longer under its management.
Due primarily to the vast increase in this
particular share of the business and the variety of
service required by travelers in different sections of
the country, it became advisable to turn over to the
various roads the details of catering to their particular
patrons. On some of the leading railroads
the highest type of dining-car service is maintained
and advertised as a particular feature. On other
roads of lesser prominence a corresponding degree of
service may be found. It is, perhaps, unfortunate
from the point of view of the traveler that the Pullman
Company found it necessary to discontinue a
service that it had so auspiciously inaugurated.</p>

<p>The installation of dining-car service immediately
drew attention to a serious defect in railway train
construction that had previously escaped notice, a
defect which was the more apparent in comparison
with the relatively high development of other features
of train construction. By the adoption of the
dining car it became necessary for the passengers to
pass from car to car across the platform while the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_106" title="106"> </a>
train was in motion, and often during a condition
of rain and snow which added discomfort to actual
danger. Where the crossing of platforms while the
train was in motion had formerly been prohibited,
the railroads were now forced to encourage passengers
to subject themselves to this dangerous procedure
in order that they might avail themselves of
the convenience of the dining cars.</p>

<p>Attempts had been made at different times to provide
a safe and covered passageway between the cars,
especially on fast express trains, but nothing of a
practical nature had resulted. In 1852 and 1855
patents were taken out for canvas devices to connect
adjoining cars and create a passage way between
them. These appliances were installed in 1857 on
a train on the Naugatuck Railroad, in Connecticut,
but soon proved to be of little practical use and were
abandoned several years later.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <div class="frame maxwidth28">
  <p class="caption2">The assembling of the steel car partitions is shown in this picture</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But in 1886 Mr. Pullman, realizing the handicap
of existing conditions to the full enjoyment of the
various types of cars which he had established, set
himself to the solving of the problem by devising a
perfect system for constructing continuous trains and
at the same time providing sufficient flexibility in the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_107" title="107"> </a>
connecting passage ways to allow for the motion of
the train, particularly when rounding curves. The
result of his efforts combined with those of his associates
was the complete solution of the problem and
the establishment of the "vestibule" train, practically
as it exists today. The vestibule patent was
granted to Mr. H. H. Sessions, of the Pullman Company,
and covered many important features, and
particularly the arrangement of the springs which
kept the cars in line in a vertical plane.</p>

<p>The vestibule was patented in 1887. By its application
the appearance of the train as a unit was
materially increased, but of far greater importance
was the contribution which it made to safety. Not
only did the enclosed vestibule afford protection to
passengers crossing the platform from one car to another,
but the entire vestibule construction immediately
gave greater safety in case of wreck by
preventing one platform from "riding" the other
and producing a telescoping of the cars.</p>

<p>The vestibule as designed and patented did not
extend to the full width of the car. It consisted of
elastic diaphragms on steel frames attached to the
ends of the cars, the faces of the diaphragms when
<a class="pagenum" id="page_108" title="108"> </a>
the train was made up, pressing firmly against each
other by powerful spiral springs which held them in
position. A further advantage of the vestibule was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_109" title="109"> </a>
the almost entire elimination of the oscillation of
the cars.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img class="plain" src="images/p108i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption1"><i>The vestibule was invented by George M. Pullman. This
illustration shows its earliest form which extended only to the width
of the doorway of the car. In 1893 it was extended to the full
width of the car.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The first vestibuled trains were put in service in
April, 1887, on the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in a
few years were adopted by every railroad using Pullman
equipment. In 1893 the vestibule was redesigned
to enclose the entire platform by means of
a drop which lowered over the stair openings, thus
increasing the roominess of the car and utilizing
every inch of possible space.</p>

<p>In the <i>Railway Review</i> of April 16, 1887, occurs
an interesting description of the first "solid-vestibuled"
train. For a number of months following,
this radical innovation was widely recognized by the
press throughout the country, and Pullman vestibuled
cars were advertised by the railroads on which
they were operated. We quote in part from the
article in the <i>Railway Review</i>:</p>

<p class="citation">This week there was turned out of the Pullman works,
at Pullman, Ill., a train of three sleepers, one dining car,
and one combination baggage and smoker, that for perfection,
in detail of manufacture and ornament, and in
completeness of comfort and luxury, is unquestionably
far ahead of any train ever before made up. This train
was on public exhibition for a few days at Chicago, and on
<a class="pagenum" id="page_110" title="110"> </a>
Friday was taken on its christening trip, over a short run
on the Illinois Central Railroad. The train is intended
for "Limited" service on the Pennsylvania system.</p>

<p class="citation">The trial trip was a success in every way. The train
went to Otto, a short distance south of Kankakee, sixty
miles from Chicago. There it was reversed on a Y, and
an opportunity afforded of witnessing its operation on a
sharp curve. The action of the flexible connection of the
vestibules was perfect. On the return trip the train was
run at a high rate of speed, and it was evident that the
cars were held very firmly together, by the springs at the
top of the vestibules, and that there was much less jarring
and swaying than is usual even on a very level track.</p>

<p>During the days in which the train was exhibited
at Van Buren street, Chicago, it was visited by approximately
20,000 people. The article continues:</p>

<p class="citation">This fact shows that the public has a deep interest in
improvements in traveling conveniences. We do not
remember that any previous invention or improvement
has ever excited such general public interest. Mr. Pullman
has again struck the popular chord.</p>

<p>The first vestibule train to the land of the Aztecs,
the "Montezuma Special," was naturally of Pullman
construction, and began regular tri-monthly
trips from New Orleans to the City of Mexico and
return, via the Southern Pacific, Mexican International,
and Mexican Central Railway, on February
7, 1889. Four magnificent cars, electrically lighted,
comprised the train. The initial trip of 1,835 miles
was made in about seventy-one hours, and on its
arrival in the City of Mexico a banquet was given
to President Diaz and his cabinet to signalize the
advent of the first international vestibule train into
the capital of Mexico.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_112" title="112"> </a>
The lighting of railway cars shows an interesting
evolution. Undoubtedly candles were used at the
earliest period, but the use of oil dates back beyond
the birthday of the Pullman car. Oil lamps, at best,
were a poor substitute for the light of day. Casting
a dim, yellow light, flickering in every draught,
smelling and smoking when not properly cared for,
and vitiating the car atmosphere, it was small wonder
that the public showed prompt appreciation of the
first substitute that was provided.</p>

<p>The brilliant Pintsch light, which for a number
of years had had wide use in Europe, was first introduced
into America by the Pullman Company on the
crack Erie train in the through New York-Chicago
service in 1883. The gas used for these lights was
of high candle power and was manufactured from
petroleum. As a car illuminant it has held its own
almost to the present day.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the part played by
the Pullman Company in the development of electric
lighting of cars. Without its inspired initiative and
its vast resources for practical and costly experiment
it is fair to believe that electricity would not have
been successfully utilized for this purpose for many
<a class="pagenum" id="page_113" title="113"> </a>
years. The <i>Railroad Gazette</i> of January 25, 1889,
expresses this thought:</p>

<p class="citation">Without extended experiments we can scarcely hope
to develop a good system of electric lighting for railroad
service. Such experiments are rather expensive, and it is
only by the co-operation of liberal-minded managers that
anything like a perfect system can be expected in a reasonable
time. The Pullman Company has great confidence
in the success of electric lighting, and therefore, in
spite of the annoyance and expense of the present system,
expresses a determination to use it, expecting that something
better will result in the near future from the
extended experience now being obtained.</p>

<p>Although the incandescent electric lamp was introduced
by Edison in 1879, following by two years
the introduction by Brush of the arc lamp, it was
on an English railway in an American Pullman car
supplied with electricity by French accumulator cells
that the electric light on October 14, 1881, barely
fifty years from the first suggestion of the iron horse
by Stephenson, cast its brilliant light for the first
time in a railway carriage.</p>

<p>The trial was made in a Pullman car, forming
part of a special train on the Brighton Railway. A
number of officials of the road, a representative of
the Pullman Company, and Mr. F. A. Pincaffs and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_114" title="114"> </a>
Mr. Lachlan of the Faure Accumulator Company
composed the party, and at 3:25 the train pulled
out of the Victoria Station for Brighton.</p>

<p>Only a few months before, Mr. Faure had sent to
Sir William Thomson his little box of lead plates
coated with red oxide and fully charged with electricity.
The great physicist saw at once its possibilities,
and in a relatively short time inventors were
developing countless applications of the new wonder.
Its application to car lighting was an important test.</p>

<p>The Pullman car on which this first experiment
was made, carried beneath it on a shelf some thirty-two
small metal boxes or cells, each containing lead
plates coated with oxide. Stored in these cells was
the power to light the car. It was nothing more than
the most elementary storage battery, a far cry from
the compact batteries of today and the massive generator
swung beneath the floor of the modern car.</p>

</div>

<p>All the previous night a steam engine had created
power to charge the cells. In the roof of the car
were twelve small Edison incandescent lights with
bamboo filaments. The light was uneven; it was
"garish," but at the turn of a switch its rays filled
the car. With pardonable enthusiasm the <i>London Times</i>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_115" title="115"> </a>
stated that "the car on the return journey in
the evening was kept lighted the whole of the distance
from Brighton to Victoria."</p>

<p>It is interesting to read in the <i>London Daily Telegraph</i>
of October 15, 1885, the following mention
of this important event:</p>

<p class="citation">Yesterday's trial was understood to have special reference,
however, to a new train, wholly composed of Pullman
cars, which it is proposed shortly to put on the
service between Victoria and Brighton, and should the
experiment be deemed fully satisfactory it is probable
that the new train will from the first be fitted with the
electric light. So far as the travelers were concerned the
result was eminently successful. It would scarcely be
possible to conceive a steadier, more equable, or more
agreeable light. On the down journey the first trial was
made in the Merstham tunnel, and then in the Balcombe
and Clayton tunnels. All that was needed was to move
the little switch, and instantaneously the delicate carbon
thread enclosed in the lamps was aglow with pure white
light. The return journey was made in the night, and
the electric lamps were alight during the whole distance.
There had been some question whether the supply would
prove sufficient, as owing to stoppages the special had
taken a somewhat longer time than had been allowed for;
the event, however, showed that the storage had been
ample. It would be possible to generate electricity by the
energy of the moving train itself, and this has indeed
been suggested to be done. By this means enough energy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_116" title="116"> </a>
could be supplied to the incandescent lamps, but in any
case the accumulator would be necessary to act as a reservoir
when the train was not in motion. It possesses, however,
another advantage equally important. Experience
shows that a current of absolutely uniform strength supplying
an even and constant light can only be derived
from stored electricity. The oxide of lead which covers
the plates not only prevents leakage, but enables the
supply to be withdrawn with perfect regularity, and renders
sub-division easy. Yesterday the smoke room and
lavatory of the car were lighted, and occasionally the
lights were turned off without in any way interfering with
the other lamps in the same circuit. Before the train
started on the return journey the brightly illuminated
carriage was an object of interest to many members of
the Iron and Steel Institute who visited Brighton and
Newhaven yesterday. With regard to expense, it is
claimed for the accumulator and the incandescent lamps
that the expenditure would be decidedly less than on
oil, while, as to the comparative value of the two there
is no room for difference of opinion. It was the general
feeling of all who took part in the excursion that the
question of the electric lighting of trains had been solved,
and that to the Brighton Company, whatever may be the
immediate results of the experiment, would belong the
honour of taking the first decisive and practical step in
the way of reform.</p>

<p>Four months later a correspondent of a Sheffield,
England, paper, writing from London to the <i>Railway
Review</i> of the recent trial of electric lights on
<a class="pagenum" id="page_117" title="117"> </a>
the Pullman train of the London, Brighton &amp; South
Coast Railway, says:</p>

<p class="citation">There is no doubt whatever on the point that this,
apart from the question of cost, is a decided success.
It is easily manageable, and diffuses through the train a
pleasant, equable light, scarcely less agreeable than daylight.
It is turned on and off with instantaneous effect
as the train enters and leaves a tunnel, and of course is
kept burning the whole of the time during the night
journeys. The electricity is stored in a number of lead
plates, which are kept in water in iron boxes in the
guard's van. There are two lots, one at either end of the
train, and two mechanics in charge of them. This discovery
of the ability to store electricity for application
to lighting purposes seems to carry the discovery farther
than anything since it was first introduced. It gets over
many difficulties which seemed insuperable&mdash;especially
the important one of the great waste of power which is
illustrated every night at the Savoy Theatre&mdash;and would
be applicable to the introduction of electricity for household
use.</p>

<p class="citation">At the Savoy, when the exigencies of the play require
that the lights should be turned down in the auditorium,
there is no cessation of the enormous power required to
produce the full effect. What happens is that by a
mechanical contrivance, the electricity is carried off from
the light and goes to waste. With this system of storing,
electricity can be used just like gas, as much or as little
as people chance to want. Another great advantage is the
freedom from jumping, inseparable from the action of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_118" title="118"> </a>
the driving power of the steam engine, or of the motion
power of water. The lights of the Brighton train burn
just as steadily as gas, an effect not in any way obtained
where the light is maintained directly by the driving
power of steam.</p>

<p class="citation">But after all, the question of gas vs. electricity will
resolve itself into one of cost, and it is here where gas
will inevitably hold its own. The fundamental principle
of the electric light is that for a given exertion of power
you obtain a given proportion of light, neither more nor
less. For every hour it is burning there will be required
a certain exactly-ascertained proportion of revolutions of
the steam engine, and therefore, if the whole town is
lighted it can be done only at a strictly proportionate
expense to the lighting of a single house. As to what that
expense will be, as compared with gas, the Brighton train
would, if we had an idea of the actual figures, afford a
precise means of information. I met on the train a well-known
gas engineer, attracted, like myself, by the novelty
of the experiment. What the electric light cost he was
not able to say, but when we take into account the capital
sunk in plant, involving a steam engine with the necessary
buildings, consumption of coal and necessary employment
of skilled labor, it must be something considerable.
Against this is the bare fact that the Brighton train could
be lighted with gas for the double journey at the cost of
10d. It is a physical impossibility that electricity should
ever come anywhere near this, and that probably explains
the singular phenomenon that at the time when electricity
is making conspicuous advances in public favor, the value
of gas shares is not only steadily maintained, but is actually
rising in the market.</p>

The present method of heating an entire train with
steam from the locomotive was satisfactorily tested
out in the winter of 1887, and was generally adopted
the following year. By this improved system the
individual heaters in each car were abolished, and
a source of much discomfort and complaint was
removed. The Pullman cars were immediately
altered to benefit by the new system.</p>

CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subheader">HOW THE CARS ARE MADE</span></h2>


<p>In former chapters has been told the story of the
birth of the Pullman car and its development
through the various phases of its evolution. Generally
speaking, this evolution for the first forty
years was characterized chiefly by the addition, at
one time or another, of certain inventions and improvements,
such as the electric light and the vestibule,
and by a changing style of interior decoration
conforming to contemporary fashions. But at no
time is recorded a change in the basic idea of car
construction that can in any measure compare with
the revolutionizing change which was recorded in
1908 by the construction of the first "all-steel"
Pullman car.</p>

<p>For a number of years steel sills and under frames
had furnished a staunch foundation for all cars manufactured
by the Pullman Company for its operation.
Further strengthened by steel vestibules, it is
to be doubted if the all-steel car offered any very
<a class="pagenum" id="page_124" title="124"> </a>
material increase in the safety already afforded to
the passengers. But the change which the steel car
brought in the process of manufacture was radical in
the extreme. The first Pullman cars, and in fact
every car up to and through the nineties, was of all-wood
construction. Wood-making machinery filled
the great shops at Pullman; carpenters and cabinet-makers
numbered a big percentage of the pay roll.
It was a wood-working industry. At one fell stroke
the old order changed to the new. The songs of the
band-saw and the planer were stilled and in their
stead rose the metallic clamor of steam hammer and
turret lathe, and the endless staccato reverberation
of an army of riveters. Ponderous machines to bend,
twist, or cut a bar or sheet of steel filled the vast
workrooms. An army of steel workers, Titans of
the past reborn to fulfill a modern destiny, fanned
the flames in their furnaces and released the leash
of sand blast, air hose, and gas flame.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <div class="frame maxwidth20">
  <p class="caption2">This great power press is engaged in shaping the

  </div>
</div>

<p>But fascinating as unquestionably was the work
of the patient artisans who inlaid the beflowered
Eastlake Pullman or the Moorish cars of another
day, there is equal romance in the product of the
modern worker who builds these rolling hostelries
<a class="pagenum" id="page_125" title="125"> </a>
of steel. Under the high glass roof the tumult of
ponderous machines fills the air with pandemonium.
At one side of one of the main aisles a half dozen
great steel girders, like keels for giant ships, lie on
the floor. These are the mighty box girders, eighty-one
feet in length and weighing over nine tons each,
which will form the backbone of future Pullmans.
To each of these girders, or sills, are riveted plates,
angles, and steel castings which extend the full
length of the car and platforms, as well as floor
beams, cross bearers, bolsters, and end sills of pressed
steel. On this foundation the side sills are riveted,
steel beams that run the entire length of the car.</p>

<p>When this gray mass of steel is finally riveted
together with its coverplates, tieplates, and floorplates,
the underframe of the car is completed&mdash;an
almost indestructible foundation which alone weighs
27,365 pounds. On this underframe the superstructure
or frame is erected to form the body of the
car. This frame is composed of pressed steel posts
and plates forming for each side a complete girder
which would by itself alone carry the entire weight
of the loaded car.</p>

<p>The roof deck is separately assembled, and as soon
<a class="pagenum" id="page_126" title="126"> </a>
as the superstructure of the car is ready it is swung
up by a crane and dropped into place. Like the rest
of the car, the roof is of steel, braced and riveted
to defy the greatest possible strains. The ends and
vestibules are now built on, piece by piece, until the
skeleton of the car is complete. The vestibules are
particularly imposing, for on each side, framing the
side doors through which the passengers enter
the car, are giant beams of steel so built into the
construction of the frame that only under most
extraordinary circumstances could the force of a collision
crush the vestibule or the car behind it.</p>

<p>The trucks which carry this tremendous burden
of steel are marvels of strength and efficiency. Each
of the two trucks has six steel wheels weighing nine
hundred pounds apiece. Added to this is the weight
of the three six hundred pound axles, the two steel
castings which form the framework for the trucks
together with the bolsters, springs, equalizers, and
brake equipment&mdash;a total weight of 42,000 pounds
for the trucks alone, contributed to the total weight
of the car.</p>

  <div class="frame maxwidth28">
  <p class="caption2">The steel end posts in position, providing strongest possible

  </div>
</div>

<p>The car is now subjected to a thorough sand-blasting,
a process that removes every particle of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_127" title="127"> </a>
scale, grease, or dirt and leaves the steel in perfect
condition to receive the first coat of paint and the
insulation. To the passenger, the presence of the
steel construction is apparent, but the insulation,
which forms a vital factor in the car's construction,
can be seen only during the process of building.
Composed of a combination of cement, hair, and asbestos,
this insulating material is packed into every
cubic inch of space between the inner and outer shells
of the roof and sides, forming a perfect non-conductor
to protect the passengers against the biting
cold of winter or the heat of summer sunshine. A
similar cement preparation is next laid on the floor,
combining the quality of a non-conductor of heat
and cold with sanitary qualities invaluable as an aid
in maintaining the cars in a strictly sanitary condition.</p>

<p>At this point in the construction the car is turned
over to the steamfitters, plumbers, and electricians,
who perform their work with the skill and dispatch
bred of a long familiarity with the particular requirements
of car construction. To see the Pullman car
at this stage is to see a network of steam-pipes and
electric conduit lacing in and out between the gaunt
<a class="pagenum" id="page_128" title="128"> </a>
steel frame of the car, and everywhere the white
plaster-like insulation packed into every cavity. As
soon as these gangs of workmen have finished, other
workers fit into place the interior panel plates, partitions,
lockers, and seat frames, and the car instantly
assumes a new and almost completed aspect. Meanwhile
the painters have completed their work on the
exterior of the car and begin the finer finish of the
interior. Here coat upon coat is laid, and after each
coat laborious rubbing to give the required finish.
The graining, by which various woods are so faithfully
imitated, is then applied, and last the varnishing.</p>

</div>

<p>The car is now completed with the exception of
the fittings. A gang of men hang curtains in the
doors and windows; the upholsterers contribute the
carpets, cushions, mattresses, and blankets; the various
little fixtures are added, and the car is finished.
<i>Steel! Veritably!</i> One man can trundle in a single
wheelbarrow all the wood that has gone into its
construction.</p>

<p>Rich Brewster green, the new paint gleaming in
the sunlight, a long line of these seventy-ton steel
mile-a-minute hostelries are waiting for the hour
<a class="pagenum" id="page_129" title="129"> </a>
when the white-jacketed porters will open their doors
in welcome to their first passengers. Above the windows
the word "Pullman" in dull gold will carry
from coast to coast the name of their founder.
Below the windows is the name of the car, selected
usually with local significance in consideration of
the lines over which that particular car will operate.</p>

<hr />

<p>In a corner of the great yards at a track end
stands a little yellow car, smaller than many of our
interurban trolley cars, the paint peeling from the
boards that have seen the changing seasons of half
a century. It is old number "9," not the earliest,
but one of the early Pullmans. Perhaps there are
nights, when the roar of the machines is stilled, that
the ghosts of a long-past day once again walk up
and down the narrow aisles, strangers to the age of
steel.</p>

CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subheader">THE OPERATION OF THE PULLMAN CAR</span></h2>


<p>On the magic carpet of Bagdad the fortunate
travelers of a fabulous age were transported
to their destination, over valley, river, and mountain
with a certainty and dispatch that has been
unparalleled in the annals of passenger transportation.
But the magic carpet, despite the generous
measure of its service, seems to have been lost to
following generations, and only its reputation,
doubtless somewhat amplified by the telling, remains
to set a high standard to succeeding transportation
enterprises.</p>

<p>Service is a much-used and a much-abused word.
It has manifold significance. It may be a personal
thing and carry the conscientious effort of individuals
eager to do for others offices which they
desire performed; it may be purely mechanical and
consist only in the provision of the "ways and
means" to secure a desired end. It may be a combination
of both; a system or organization instituted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_134" title="134"> </a>
for the accomplishment of a duty or work beneficial
to a community. A great railroad affords such
a service. Greater in its scope than any railroad,
the Pullman Company provides a more vast, intricate,
and complete service to the people of the
United States, a service unequaled in all the world.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <p class="caption2">Pullman sleeping car, latest design, with outline drawing showing how the car is supplied with light,
water, and heat</p>
</div>

<p>A study of the scope and ramifications of the
Pullman operations deserves more than passing comment;
it is of interest to everyone, for everyone is
to some degree a traveler; an actual or a potential
Pullman patron. In preceding chapters has been
traced the story of passenger transportation in
America; how the first railroads offered communication
only between a few closely related cities, and
how later the growth of the railroads brought into
direct communication practically every village and
metropolis throughout the land. Then came the
time when the inadequacy of such complete but disconnected
service struck the imagination of a man
who saw the endless miles of track of countless railroads
bound together by a supplemental system to
which all railroads contributed and from which they
profited, and by which, most of all, the public would
enjoy a service of a scope which could otherwise only
<a class="pagenum" id="page_135" title="135"> </a>
be attained by an actual combination of these railroads
into a single company. But the vision of the
founder of the Pullman Company did not stop at
the idea of a unified system. He had not only seen
the discomfort and inconvenience of countless
changes from one train to another at railroad junctions
and the midnight gatherings on the station
platform; he had seen in tired eyes the fatigue of
sleeplessness; he had seen in the preponderance of
male passengers the lack of a protection sufficient to
permit the free travel of unescorted women; he had
realized, and his realization ranks high with the
thoughts of the world's innovators, that travel was
a hardship and that it could be made a pleasure.</p>

<p>With the realization constantly before him that
the most perfect service could be given only by the
most radically improved equipment and the widest
extension of this company's activities, Mr. Pullman
identified the early years of organization with a
development of the passenger car to a degree of comfort,
convenience, safety, and luxury that passed
popular comprehension. Nothing was too good for
the Pullman car; too much money could not be
invested in it. Hand in hand with this development
<a class="pagenum" id="page_136" title="136"> </a>
of the mechanical side of service he developed
its extension throughout the country, by means of
which it might be put into the hands of the greatest
number of people for their greater convenience.
Never has history more completely justified a business
that from its character must be to a certain
extent a monopoly. Never has competition more
promptly yielded to unification.</p>

<p>It is natural to think of the Pullman Company
as housed in some miraculous manner in the cars
which it operates, as a company which expends its
restless existence in untiring travel from state to
state. But, as a matter of fact, the vast organization
which makes possible the movement of the
seventy-five hundred cars which comprise the present
equipment holds an interest secondary only to the
actual operation of the cars themselves.</p>

<p>There was a day when the run from Albany to
Schenectady was the longest continuous railroad
ride that a traveler might take. Today it is possible
to travel in a Pullman car without change from
Washington, D. C., to San Francisco, a distance of
3,625 miles, requiring one hundred and eighteen
hours, or approximately five days.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_137" title="137"> </a>
But distance is not alone characteristic of Pullman
service; equal attention is given to shorter
"hauls." From Greensboro to Raleigh, North
Carolina, for instance, a distance of only eighty-one
miles, Pullman sleeping cars are regularly operated.
Here, as in many other instances, arrangements exist
whereby the passengers may retire early in the evening
while the car is at rest on a siding in the station,
and arise at a reasonable hour in the morning. By
such service hotel accommodations are practically
afforded and it becomes possible for the travelers to
have a whole day for pleasure or business at one
place, spend a night in which a hundred or five
hundred miles are traversed, and arrive without
fatigue at another place the following morning.</p>

<p>The hotel desk corresponds to the ticket office of
the Pullman Company. Imagine a hotel with
260,000 beds and 2,950 office desks, and a total
registration of 26,000,000 people each year. This
is what the Pullman Company does, however, and
incidentally it does it often at a mile a minute and
in every state in the Union. The 2,950 offices
where Pullman berths, seats, drawing rooms or compartments
may be purchased include Quebec,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_138" title="138"> </a>
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Vancouver on the north;
San Diego, El Paso, New Orleans, Key West, and
Havana on the south; San Francisco on the west,
and the seaboard towns of Maine on the east.
Under normal conditions the southern limit is still
further extended to fifty-six additional offices in the
Republic of Mexico, as far south as Salina Cruz on
the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and approximately two
hundred miles from the boundary between Mexico
and Guatemala, Central America.</p>

<p>The longest distance which it is possible to travel
with a single Pullman ticket is from Portland,
Maine, to San Francisco, by the way of Washington,
D. C., New Orleans and Los Angeles. This
cannot be done, however, in one sleeper, and changes
must be made at New York and Washington.
But a brief consideration of the perfect organization
necessary to provide such continuous passage
with berths reserved at each point of change
by the mere purchase of a ticket at the starting point,
grants to the Pullman Company a measure of credit
due. In actual mileage the distance covered by this
trip is 4,199.</p>

</div>

<p>As a rule the berths in sleeping cars and seats in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_139" title="139"> </a>
parlor cars are on sale at the terminals of the different
lines, but to provide facilities at intermediate
points where the demand is sufficient to justify it, a
limited number of sections are assigned for sale at
such stations and tickets may be purchased from
them on application. At stations of less importance
and where the demand is not sufficient to assign any
definite space, an arrangement exists whereby the
vacant accommodations are telegraphed by ticket
agents or conductors from point to point in order to
accommodate passengers taking the trains at such
stations. It is also possible and a very common
practice to purchase a single sleeping car ticket
between stations a great distance apart&mdash;for
instance, between Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
and Washington, to Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Portland, and Seattle, via any of the ordinary
routes of travel, by sufficient notice to the ticket
agent to enable his reserving the accommodations,
and it is also possible to purchase under similar conditions
a sleeping car ticket in Havana, Cuba, for
a berth, section, or drawing room from Key West,
Florida, to Seattle, Washington, a distance of 3,923
miles, taking one hundred and thirty-three hours;
<a class="pagenum" id="page_140" title="140"> </a>
not, however, without change, but in connecting
cars, giving continuous sleeping car service over
various routes.</p>

<p>During the year 1916, 16,398,450 tickets of
various forms were printed in Chicago and distributed
to the various ticket offices, and in addition,
8,150,000 cash-fare tickets or checks were issued by
conductors to travelers purchasing on the train.</p>

<p>In addition to offices where tickets may be purchased,
arrangements exist in many thousands of
smaller points whereby the public may secure sleeping-car
accommodations by application to the station
agent or other representative of the railroad company,
who will arrange by telephone, telegraph, or
letter the desired space to be called for, with a
reasonable time at a designated point.</p>

<p>In order to extend to the public every courtesy
consistent with lawful requirements and good business
principles, the Pullman Company endeavors to
provide prompt and careful attention to all requests
for refund of fares where service paid for is not
furnished, whether through the acts of its agents or
employees or the passenger, or due to interruption
of traffic.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_141" title="141"> </a>
Applications of this nature are usually made to
the company's general offices in Chicago, but when
this is not convenient, a report made to the company's
representative in any of the important cities
throughout the country is forwarded to the central
offices and receives the most careful consideration.</p>

<p>It would seem of interest in this connection to
state that during the year 1916, 53,743 applications,
amounting to $152,446.00, were received for refund
of fares, an average of one hundred and seventy-nine
for each working day. Of the total number
received 48,025 were considered favorably and
paid, indicating the liberal policy of the company
in such matters. Regardless of the amount involved,
great or small, it is necessary that each case be considered
on its individual merits, and the result
determined with due regard to fairness to the passenger
and the company, and not conflicting with
legal necessities.</p>

<p>Probably seventy-five per cent of these requests
for refunds are occasioned by passengers changing
their plans or missing their train. Most frequent is
the reason given that the wife has packed the tickets
in the trunk, that the cab or taxi broke down, or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_142" title="142"> </a>
that the last act of the theater caused unrealized
delay. Often the tickets are lost, and not infrequently
they are turned in by others for refund.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>But one of the most convenient features of the
Pullman service is the ease with which the traveler
may reserve in advance accommodations on the
train which he intends to take. In the ordinary
railway coach it is a rule of "first come, first served"
and the late arrival is often obliged to take a seat
with a stranger. By the Pullman system, however,
a call over the telephone or a stop at the local ticket
office is all that is necessary to make as definite
reservation of space as for a theater, and the traveler
is wroth indeed when in rare instances a slip occurs
and he finds his seat or berth has not been held for
him and has been sold to another.</p>

<p>Naturally so general a convenience has led to
rank abuses from which the passengers invariably
suffer. Chief among them is the practice of hotel
clerks and porters, especially in large cities and at
summer and winter resorts, to reserve far in advance
all the desirable Pullman accommodations on popular
trains in the names of supposititious travelers
whom they claim to represent, and later sell these
<a class="pagenum" id="page_143" title="143"> </a>
tickets to the hotel guests at a premium or for the tip
which invariably follows.</p>

<p>By such practice the distribution of space is placed
in the hands of outside parties, out of the control
of the railroads or the Pullman Company, and the
traveler is obliged to look to these irresponsible
individuals for his accommodations. In addition,
the tip or extra fee increases the cost of the ticket,
errors in "duplicate sales" are made more frequent,
and a critical and unfriendly feeling is created in
the mind of the passenger who has been unable to
secure a "lower" on early application at the ticket
office, but was able perhaps to secure one at train
time from the unused tickets turned in by hotel
porters. Naturally the feeling is created that the
railroad or Pullman agents are holding back space
for a tip or a favorite, and "playing favorites" is
never popular with the public.</p>

<p>There are several good stories told of the action
of the Pullman Company in cases where they "had
the goods" on the offending hotel porters. As the
company is in no sense required by law to make
refund, but does so only for a convenience to its
patrons, it is possible to refuse to make a refund if
<a class="pagenum" id="page_144" title="144"> </a>
the case justifies the action. At a popular watering
place an enterprising hotel employee figured out
that on the day following Easter a large number of
guests would leave on a certain popular train.
Accordingly, like the theater "scalper," he purchased
outright a large block of tickets on this train, in fact,
every lower on the two Pullman sleepers. Fortunately
the local agent of the company sensed that
there was something "rotten in the state of Denmark"
and made provision for two additional sleepers
beyond the usual two which travel warranted.
Being able to secure satisfactory accommodations
direct from the agent the passengers failed to patronize
the hotel porter's be-tipped and premiumed
wares, and he, "stuck with the goods," tried a few
days later to throw them back for refund on the
Pullman Company. Their refusal cost him an even
hundred dollars and broke up a peculiarly bad condition
in that particular locality.</p>

<p>Many, indeed, are the difficulties attending the
operation of a system of such magnitude, and it is
only by a consideration of these difficulties that the
true wonder of a service so nearly perfect can be
appreciated.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_145" title="145"> </a>
The operation of a system of such magnitude as
the Pullman Company necessitates an operating
organization letter perfect in its detail. Such an
organization cannot be built to order; it must be a
development, the result of years of wearying experience
and costly experiment. In the introduction to
the official book of instruction provided to car
employees of the company, occurs, above the signature
of the general superintendent, this sentence:
"The most important feature to be observed at all
times is to satisfy and please passengers." It is an
apparently simple commission, a natural expression
of desire, but a brief investigation of the requirements
necessary "to satisfy and please" twenty-six
million passengers, traveling rapidly from place to
place, from north to south and from coast to coast,
regardless of climate or locality, discloses a service
and machinery for the carrying out of that service
complete beyond the realization of the most discerning
traveler.</p>

<p>To comprehend more clearly the details of this
nation-wide service it must be considered in its two
aspects&mdash;the material equipment which the operation
of the cars requires, and the personal service
<a class="pagenum" id="page_146" title="146"> </a>
afforded by the employees of the company. To give
this service 7,500 cars of the Pullman Company are
operated over one hundred and thirty-seven railroads,
or a total of 223,489 miles of track, reaching
practically every point in the country from which
or to which a person might desire to travel. To
operate these cars an army of over ten thousand car
employees are required, while seven thousand more
are employed to keep the cars in repair, and maintain
them in a clean and sanitary condition.</p>

<p>The Pullman Company maintains, in addition to
the great plant at Pullman, six repair shops situated
at various convenient points throughout the country
where cars are repaired and maintained in good condition.
In 1916, a total of 5,115 cars were repaired
at these various shops at a cost of over five million
dollars. Only by such rigid maintenance can the
cars be kept in the almost invariably excellent condition
in which they are found by the public.</p>

</div>

<p>Years ago the wearied traveler wrapped his great
coat about him for his midnight journey. Later a
few "sleeping" cars of primitive construction provided
sheets and blankets which were stored in a
cupboard in the end of the car. As these were
<a class="pagenum" id="page_147" title="147"> </a>
washed only at irregular intervals, it was a lucky
passenger who found clean linen for his bed, and
if he did not make up the bed himself, it was the
brakeman who provided this domestic service. Naturally
no one thought of undressing for the night,
and when the Pullman car was first introduced it
was necessary to print on the back of the tickets and
in the employees' rules book the warning that passengers
must not retire with their boots on.</p>

<p>Today the Pullman Company to provide clean
linen nightly for each passenger, keeps on hand
1,858,178 sheets, which are valued at $980,553.00,
and 1,403,354 pillow slips worth $186,475.00. In
the twelve months ending April 27, 1916, over two
hundred thousand sheets, valued at over one hundred
thousand dollars, and nearly two hundred thousand
pillow cases, valued at over twenty thousand dollars,
were condemned. And during the same period
108,492,359 pieces of linen, including both sheets
and pillow cases were washed and ironed. In the
matter of condemnation, it is interesting to learn
that the slightest tear or stain is considered sufficient
cause. These figures are staggering in their immensity,
but even more amazing is the system by which
<a class="pagenum" id="page_148" title="148"> </a>
these articles are provided, changed, washed,
returned in traveling hotels, at times hundreds of
miles removed from the nearest supply station.</p>

<p>In the oldtime washroom a roller towel gave satisfaction
to travelers less particular than those of the
present day. But now how things have changed.
Two million seven hundred thousand towels are
needed to supply an ever increasing demand. Three
hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars was their
cost and each year seventy million towels is the
laundry order. When Brown has shaved in the
men's washroom in good American style, he will
probably wipe his razor on a towel. It is not his
custom at home, but the traveler seems to have
scant respect for property. That one little cut will
destroy the towel for future service. Pullman towels
rarely have a chance to wear out. Over a hundred
thousand a year are condemned chiefly because of
such usage, and, sad to relate, each year over half
a million are "lost." A Pullman towel is a handy
wrapping for a pair of shoes, but the annual lost
charge amounts to nearly seventy thousand dollars.
It is a charge that must be accepted by the company.
It will not do to question a passenger's integrity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_149" title="149"> </a>
All told, the investment by the Pullman Company
in car linen amounts to $1,856,708.00,
representing 6,597,714 separate pieces. And this
is only for sleeping and parlor cars and a relatively
small number of buffet and private cars, for the
company no longer operates the diners. To provide
new linen to replace the lost and condemned costs
an annual sum of over four hundred thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>But the quantities and the cost of other articles
which the company provides are even more impressive.
These, for the most part, are expressions of
Pullman service over and above the service itself,
but it is unquestionably true that by such "over and
above" service is the whole service most truly
judged. Who would think, for instance, that in one
year 5,819,656 women's hats were protected against
dust by paper bags provided by the porters. And
yet these paper bags represented a total cost of
$14,549.00. Smokers in the same period consumed
two million boxes of matches, and over forty-two
million drinking cups costing nearly eighty thousand
dollars gave the modern touch of sanitation to the
water coolers. Soap would naturally be considered
<a class="pagenum" id="page_150" title="150"> </a>
an essential part of the service, but a soap bill for
one year of sixty thousand dollars is a large order
for cleanliness. So, too, is the sum of $20,000 for
hair brushes and a third of that amount for combs.</p>

<p>Back in the dark ages of blissful ignorance of
germs, railroad coaches were hallowed breeding
places for sickness. But times have changed, and
today it is a pretty safe remark to make that the
Pullman car is more healthful than almost any place
where people frequently congregate. It does not
take many gray hairs to remember the days of sleeping
cars furnished with heavy carpets tacked to
wooden floors, of stuffy hangings, and plush
upholstery, of fancy woodwork rife with cracks and
crannies, and of washrooms and toilets that no
amount of cleaning could ever maintain entirely
innocuous.</p>

<p>It is difficult to enumerate the countless little
details that are constantly incorporated into Pullman
car construction. The berth light has been
frequently changed to embody some new idea to
improve its convenience and efficiency. The coat
hanger, and the mirror in the upper berth are minor
details, but their convenience is attested by their
<a class="pagenum" id="page_151" title="151"> </a>
constant use by passengers. In the washrooms the
design of the wash basins has been frequently
altered to afford a more convenient resting place
for the toilet articles unpacked from the traveler's
bag. Even the location of a coat hook receives a
consideration that would perhaps seem exaggerated
to the casual outsider. Double curtains are now
provided on the newer cars, one set for the lower
and another set for the upper berth.</p>

<p>Once a month a Committee on Standards, composed
of the higher officials of the company, meets
at the big plant at Pullman. On a track near the
main entrance, stands a car in which every practical
suggestion has been incorporated for the inspection
of the committee. Some of these suggestions are
quickly eliminated by their experienced verdict;
others, possessing apparent worthiness, are passed
and are later incorporated in the construction of
the next cars manufactured, when the public will
become the final judge. Many of these improvements
are of a technical character, and primarily
affect the construction of the cars; others are of a
more directly personal nature and contribute more
to the comfort and convenience of the traveler. All
<a class="pagenum" id="page_152" title="152"> </a>
that are passed by the committee serve to place
still higher the standard that for fifty years has
been constantly uplifted by the company.</p>

</div>

<p>As a car-building material wood has had its day,
and the concrete floor of the Pullman car is tacit
tribute to the sanitary properties of a widely used
material. On the floor of concrete the familiar
green carpet is lightly stretched to be easily removed
at the journey's end, and after the floor has been
thoroughly scrubbed, returned after a complete
cleansing with vacuum cleaners. Instead of insanitary
woodwork, the smooth surfaces of steel which
form the interior of the car offer no lurking place
for germs, and soap and water at frequent and
regular intervals maintain a high degree of cleanliness.
Of course, the porter with his portable vacuum
cleaners and his dustcloth, can keep the car tidy en
route, but the real cleaning comes when the trip is
over and a gang of professional workers with every
appliance to serve this end attacks the cars. Then
not only are the carpets renovated but the prying
nozzles of powerful vacuum cleaners suck up every
particle of dust from seats, berths and cushions.
Each mattress is given similar treatment, and mattresses
<a class="pagenum" id="page_153" title="153"> </a>
and pillows are hung in the open air for the
action of that greatest of all purifiers, the sun.
Blankets are given a similar treatment. Water
coolers are cleaned and sterilized with steam. In
fact, nothing that could harbor a speck of dust is
neglected.</p>

<p>The slight, acrid odor sometimes noticeable in a
Pullman car at the beginning of a run is caused by
the disinfectants which are liberally employed. A
jug of disinfectant solution is a part of the equipment
of every car and this is used for all car washing
and particularly on the floors and in the toilet and
washrooms.</p>

<p>To protect still further the health of the passengers,
the cars are regularly fumigated with a gas
which kills all disease-producing bacteria. Whenever
a car has carried a sick person it is fumigated
as soon as it is vacated, in addition to the regular
monthly, weekly, or other schedule of fumigation
for various lines and terminals. In order that the
district offices may be promptly informed as to the
necessity of this extra fumigation, the conductor is
required to note on his inspection report the fact
that a sick passenger has been carried, and the car
<a class="pagenum" id="page_154" title="154"> </a>
is immediately taken out of service and thoroughly
cleaned and fumigated. Moreover, if space occupied
by a sick passenger is vacated en route, it must
not be resold until the car has reached its terminal
and has been fumigated.</p>

<p>To provide the necessary facilities for car cleaning,
the company maintains a cleaning force in
two hundred and twenty-five principal yards, and,
in addition, at one hundred and fifty-eight outlying
points. These yards require the service of over four
thousand cleaners.</p>

<p>Stationed throughout the United States, in nearly
every city of prominence, are six superintendents,
thirty-nine district superintendents and thirty agents.
These men each week make personal inspection of
cars in operation with the sole purpose of keeping
the service up to the highest standard. In addition,
a corps of electrical and mechanical inspectors constantly
inspect and test the cars and their devices,
at various places, and another corps of local inspectors
carefully examine every departing and every
incoming train with particular attention to the
appearance and deportment of the car employees and
the apparatus for heating, lighting and water.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_155" title="155"> </a>
The Pullman Company is today the greatest single
employer of colored labor in the world. Trained as
a race by years of personal service in various
capacities, and by nature adapted faithfully to
perform their duties under circumstances which
necessitate unfailing good nature, solicitude, and
faithfulness, the Pullman porters occupy a unique
place in the great fields of employment. There are
porters who for over forty years have been employed
by the company, and of all the porters employed, an
army of nearly eight thousand, twenty-five per cent
have been for over ten years in continuous service.
The reputation of any company depends in a large
measure on the character of its employees, and particularly
in those concerns which render a personal
service to the general public is it necessary that the
standards of the employees be exceptionally high.
Such standards of personal service cannot be quickly
developed; they can be achieved only through years
of experience and the close personal study of the
wide range of requirements of those who are to be
served.</p>

<p>To inspire in the car employees, conductors as
well as porters, the ambition to satisfy and please
<a class="pagenum" id="page_156" title="156"> </a>
the passenger, rewards of extra pay are made for
unblemished records of courtesy; pensions are provided
for the years that follow their retirement from
active service; provision is made for sick relief, and
at regular intervals increases in pay are awarded
with respect to the number of years of continuous
and satisfactory employment.</p>

<p>One characteristic of the Pullman business that is
peculiarly significant is the average length of service
of the employees. In a general way it may truly
be said that from the car porter to the highest official
every man who enters the business enters it as a life
work. In most lines of business there is a variety
of concerns operating along similar lines, and it is
a natural step for a man to pass up from one company
to another. But the unique position held by
the Pullman Company has eliminated such a situation,
and a man entering its employ looks forward
to a personal development in this one concern.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p156i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption2">JOHN S. RUNNELLS<br />
President of the Pullman Company</p>
</div>

<p>During the half-century which has seen the sure
and perfect development of this vast and complicated
organization it is but natural to expect among
the names of those who have guided its destiny many
that must rank high in the business history of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_157" title="157"> </a>
country. A glance at the list of past and present
Directors of the company confirms the expectation.
Here are the names of men who have found high
places in a variety of business activities not only in
Chicago but in other great cities. The list includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>George M. Pullman</li>
  <li>John Crerar</li>
  <li>Norman Williams</li>
  <li>Robert Harris</li>
  <li>Thomas A. Scott</li>
  <li>Amos T. Hall</li>
  <li>C. G. Hammond</li>
  <li>J. P. Morgan</li>
  <li>Marshall Field</li>
  <li>J. W. Doane</li>
  <li>H. C. Hulbert</li>
  <li>O. S. A. Sprague</li>
  <li>Henry R. Reed</li>
  <li>Norman B. Ream</li>
  <li>William K. Vanderbilt</li>
  <li>John S. Runnells</li>
  <li>Frederick W. Vanderbilt</li>
  <li>W. Seward Webb</li>
  <li>Robert T. Lincoln</li>
  <li>Frank O. Lowden</li>
  <li>John J. Mitchell</li>
  <li>Chauncey Keep</li>
  <li>George F. Baker</li>
  <li>John A. Spoor</li>
</ul>

<p>In this same period but three men have occupied
the office of president: George M. Pullman, the
founder of the company, who held office from 1867,
the year of incorporation, until his death in 1897,
and Robert T. Lincoln until 1911, when John S.
Runnells, the present president, was elected.</p>

<p>Pullman service has revolutionized the method of
travel. Night has been abolished, the sense of distance
has been annihilated; fatigue has been reduced
to a minimum. In the oldest districts of the east,
along the valleys of western rivers, on the wide-spread
<a class="pagenum" id="page_158" title="158"> </a>
plains, among the remote peaks of the Rockies,
in the deserts of the great southwest, the Pullman
car, served by the same trained employees, furnishes
the same comforts, and gives the same nights' repose.
Improved each year in its mechanical construction,
amplified in its service, better served by its attendants,
it has set a high standard to the world in the
development of railway travel, and in the fifty years
of its development it has contributed more to the
safety, comfort, convenience, and luxury of travelers
than any other similar contribution that has been
given to mankind.</p>
